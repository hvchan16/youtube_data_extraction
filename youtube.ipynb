The uncatchable fish named Catfish Hunter grows fatter. The wisecracks, zingers and put downs pile up like freshly raked leaves. And GRUMPY OLD MEN become grumpier in the sequel that's \"pure delight, a wonderfully warmhearted comedy\" (David Sheehan, CBS-TV). Grabbing fishing rods and picking up where they left off, JACK LEMMON and WALTER MATTHAU reel in another comedy winner as GRUMPIER OLD MEN. ANN-MARGRET, DARYL HANNAH, KEVIN POLLACK and BURGESS MEREDITH also return to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to reprise their roles. And SOPHIA LOREN is the newcomer whose plan to turn the town's beloved bait shop into a ristorante sends the old boys into a tizzy. Be advised: a tizzy is very contagious. Get ready to laugh. And stay tuned for the outtakes, including \"man-sized manicotti!\" \"Better, funnier and even grumpier than the original.\"  - Joel Siegel, GOOD MORNING AMERICA/ABC-TV (c) 1995 Warner Bros.

The film chronicles the lives and times of three characters: \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a bookmaking wizard; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a Mafia underboss and longtime best friend to Ace; and Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in a role she was born to play), a leggy ex-prostitute with a fondness for jewelry and a penchant for playing the field. Ace plays by the rules (albeit Vegas rules, which, as he reminds the audience in voiceover, would make him a criminal in any other state), while Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat, and steal their respective ways to the top. The film's first hour and a half details their rise to power, while the second half follows their downfall as the FBI, corrupt government officials, and angry mob bosses pick apart their Camelot piece by piece.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Universal (1995)\n","Cast: Robert De Niro, Alan King, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Sharon Stone\n","Director: Martin Scorsese\n","Producers: Barbara De Fina, Joseph P.

The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, but as he delves into the mystery, he hears voices, loses his bearings, and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines, who seems to be a raving lunatic, holds the key to the puzzle.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Universal (1995)\n","Cast: Brad Pitt, Christopher Plummer, Christopher Meloni\n","Director: Terry Gilliam\n","Producers: Robert Cavallo, Mark Egerton, Robert Kosberg, Gary Levinsohn, Lloyd Phillips, Charles Roven, Kelley Smith-Wait\n","Screenwriters: Chris Marker, David Webb Peoples, Janet Peoples\n","\n","WHO ARE WE?\n","The MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

But like many of us, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) never could have predicted the course his own life would take, when he reluctantly accepts a job as a teacher. \n","\n","A musician and composer consumed with a love for music, Holland's true goal is to write one memorable piece of music to leave his mark on the world. But instead, he finds his calling in the most unlikely place, sharing his love of music with his students--to let it fill their lives, the way it fills his. His students respond to his contagious passion, and as the years unfold, Holland finds himself on an unplanned path. \n","\n","Redefining success and his own dreams, Holland realizes that his legacy will be greater than he ever dreamed. And with the help of his students and his family, Glenn Holland learns that though our lives don't always turn out the way we plan them, life is what happens when you embrace the unexpected.\n","\n","Genres: Drama and Musical/Performing Arts \n"," \n","Running Time: 2 hrs. 25 min. \n"," \n","MPAA Rating: PG \n"," \n","Distributors: Buena Vista Pictures Distribution \n"," \n","Production Co.: Hollywood Pictures, Radar Pictures, Charlie Mopic Company \n"," \n","U.S. Box Office: $82,564,043 \n"," \n","Filming Locations: Portland, Oregon, USA \n"," \n","Produced in: United States\n","\n","Starring: Richard Dreyfuss, Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas, Olympia Dukakis, William H.

This gets tough amidst the on-going fight with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and his attempt to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Meanwhile, his friend and alter ego Randall (Jeff Anderson) is working behind the counter of the adjacent video store -- at least when he feels like it. Randall's unabashed disdain of his place of employment, a long with his self-admitted hatred towards its customers is a sharp contrast to Dante's feeble attempts at the niceties of customer service. Much of the film consists of Randall and Dante's criticism of their customers, their lives, and the world in general.

Jackson Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman\n","\n","FILM DESCRIPTION:\n","Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Miramax Films (1994)\n","Cast: John Travolta, Samuel L.

When Ryan discovers that the President's wealthy friend was in league with the cartel, the President's devious national security adviser (Harris Yulin) and an ambitious CIA deputy director (Henry Czerny) send a secret paramilitary force into Colombia to wipe out the drug lords. The force is captured and then abandoned by the President's lackeys.

Tom Hanks excelled even himself with his performance as an AIDS striken homosexual who is fired from his job simply because of his condition. It is Hanks, by himself, who makes the whole scenario in the film believable. Although this is Hanks's best performance of his career, he is very closely followed by Denzel Washington who gives a perfect performance as the only lawyer who will take on the case although he is a homophobe himself. The emotional strain of the film on the audience is immense and in the later stages of the film it is almost impossible to watch because of that. The make-up which gives the impression that Hanks really does have the terrible disease is perfect and the simple yet striking direction from Jonathan Demme(The Silence Of The Lambs) make this utterly compelling viewing although at times it is very uncomfortable. All praise to everyone in the making of this beautiful film.\n","\n","Cast: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Roberta Maxwell, Buzz Kilman, Karen Finley, Daniel Chapman, Mark Sorensen Jr., Jeffrey Williamson, Charles Glenn, Ron Vawter, Anna Deavere Smith, Stephanie Roth Haberle, Lisa Talerico, Joanne Woodward, Jason Robards.\n","\n","Plot Keywords: Pennsylvania, City Name In Title, Philadelphia, Male Nurse, Gay Lead Character, Bigotry, AIDS, Gay Rights, Disease, Prejudice, Homosexual, Homophobia, Medical, Terminal Illness, Gay Slur, Political, Philadelphia Pennsylvania, Blockbuster, Costume Party, Gay Interest, Hospital, Lawyer, Library, Mother Son Relationship, Trial, Sexuality.\n","    Channel Title: ciwciwdotcom\n","    Publish time: 2008-05-12T21:16:44Z\n","    Duration: 3:3\n","    Number of comments: 521\n","    Number of likes: 4108\n","    Number of dislikes: 146\n","    Number of views: 1999853\n","    \n","    Title: The Piano (1993) Official Trailer - Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin Movie HD\n","    Description: Subscribe to CLASSIC TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u43jDe\n","Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\n","Subscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\n","Like us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\n","The Piano (1993) Official Trailer - Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin Movie HD\n","\n","Set in 1851, a mute Scottish woman arrives in colonial New Zealand for an arranged marriage, with her precocious young daughter and beloved piano in tow.

Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen John Connor (Edward Furlong), during the late nineties. Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about humankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 (Schwarzenegger) is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps break Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two Terminators at a steel foundry. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which won four Oscars in technical categories for its groundbreaking effects, was followed by a short sequel filmed exclusively as an attraction for theme parks, Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time (1996). - Karl Williams, Rovi\n","\n","More on Terminator 2: Judgement Day at:\n","http://www.MovieBout.com/index.php?movie=178\n","\n","MovieBout.com - The Movie Discovery Assistant\n","http://www.MovieBout.com\n","    Channel Title: TheReviewLib\n","    Publish time: 2012-07-31T17:32:11Z\n","    Duration: 2:6\n","    Number of comments: 32\n","    Number of likes: 388\n","    Number of dislikes: 27\n","    Number of views: 194763\n","    \n","    Title: Dances With Wolves - Official® Trailer [HD]\n","    Description: Release Date: November 21, 1990\n","\n","A historical drama about the relationship between a Civil War soldier and a band of Sioux Indians, Kevin Costner's directorial debut was also a surprisingly popular hit, considering its length, period setting, and often somber tone.

Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer) is unemployed and aimless, hovering between childhood and adult responsibilities. A year out of college, Tom can't land a decent job -- he still lives with his mother in Brooklyn. He receives a call from Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), who informs Tom that her son Bill, Tom's best friend in high school, has killed himself. She wants Tom to deliver the eulogy and serve as a pallbearer, and flustered, Tom agrees, though he has no recollection of Bill. After delivering a lackluster eulogy, Tom meets the grieving Ruth and begins an impulsive affair with her. He also encounters Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful classmate for whom he's long carried a torch. Although Julie at first mistakes Tom for someone else, they begin dating, while he keeps his relationship with Ruth a secret. First-time writer-director Matt Reeves work-shopped the script for The Pallbearer with writing partner Jason Katims at the Sundance Institute. Reeves went on to create the TV series Felicity.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Miramax Films (1996)\n","Cast: David Schwimmer, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael Vartan\n","Director: Matt Reeves\n","Producers: J.J.

William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named \"Nobody,\" who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody's help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic, his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror, and emerges into a previously-unknown world that exists on the other side.\n","\n","Welcome to the Fandango MOVIECLIPS Trailer Vault Channel.

Most of his friends, however, have graduated to the instant financial gratification of petty drug dealing. Hank yearns to escape his neighborhood and spends his entire savings on lottery tickets hoping to win the $27 Million Dollar Jackpot. His dad, Milt, doesn't set much of an example--working a brain-numbing job at the phone company and soothing the ache of a ruined marriage and a dead-end career as a musician with his constant companion--a bottle of whiskey. Hank seeks his comfort through Joy, his Latina girlfriend, who has her eyes set on the future. As their romance grows--another begins. Hank's father and Florence, Joy's adoptive mother, struggle to deal with their rapidly changing children. In doing so, they find themselves seeing each other in new ways. Their relationship is warm, cautious, and based on the surprise of mutual respect.               Produced by  Carlos Hernandez (III), John Rubino, Michael J.

Grant plays Peter Joshua, who meets Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) in Paris and later offers to help her when she discovers that her husband has been murdered. After the funeral, Reggie is summoned to the embassy and warned by agent/friend Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) that her late husband helped steal 250,000 dollars during the war and that the rest of the gang is after the money as well. When three of the men who attended her husband's funeral begin to harass her, Reggie goes to Joshua for help, at which time Joshua confesses that his name is actually Alexander Dyle, the brother of a fourth accomplice in the gold theft. The three men from the funeral are revealed to be the three other accomplices in the crime, and though she knows next to nothing of the heist, Reggie is caught in a ring of suspense as she is followed by the shadowy trio, all after the money. Apparently, the only person she can trust is Joshua/Dyle -- until Bartholomew tells Reggie that the fourth accomplice had no brother, and Joshua/Dyle reveals that he is, in fact, a crook named Adam Canfield. Now Reggie doesn't know where to turn. The musical score by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini was nominated for an Academy Award.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Universal (1963)\n","Cast: James Coburn, Cary Grant, George Kennedy, Walter Matthau, Audrey Hepburn\n","Director: Stanley Donen\n","Producers: Stanley Donen, James H.

Carole Lombard's swan song earned her some of her finest reviews posthumously, but the film itself, daringly dark for the time, was generally regarded as an insensitive and even troubling satire of wartime issues. The title refers not only to Shakespeare but the questionable existence of Poland. It has since been recognized as one of the director's finest efforts and a brilliantly cast comedy classic. Remade in 1983 with Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft in the leads.\n","\n","Find more at http://www.trailersfromhell.com\n","\n","ABOUT JOE DANTE\n","\n","JOE DANTE is a lifelong film buff who turned his obsession into a career.

Previously, Dick Powell was known only for comedies and musicals, so his appearance in a film noir makes Murder My Sweet an especially unique choice for your mystery collection. His name is Phillip Marlowe, and for the right price, this private eye will follow an unfaithful husband, find a missing bankroll, or spy on a suspicious neighbor. When he's drawn into a complex web of murder, blackmail and double-dealing, the result is the quintessential film-noir—the one that set the standard for the noir genre.\n","    Channel Title: Warner Bros.\n","    Publish time: 2015-07-22T18:04:07Z\n","    Duration: 2:9\n","    Number of comments: 2\n","    Number of likes: 146\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 29853\n","    \n","    Title: MACAO (1952) Theatrical Trailer - Robert Mitchum, Jane Russell, William Bendix\n","    Description: Nick Cochran, an American in exile in Macao, has a chance to restore his name by helping capture an international crime lord.

At its center is Brian Cohen, born in Bethleham in a stable next door, who, by a series of absurd circumstances is caught up in the new religion and reluctantly mistaken for the promised messiah, providing ample opportunity for the entire ensemble (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) to shine in mulitple roles as they question everyone and everything from ex-lepers, Pontius Pilate and haggling to revolutionaries, crazy prophets, religious fanaticism, Roman centurions and crucifixion, forever changing our biblical view.\n","    Channel Title: awesomefilmtrailers\n","    Publish time: 2009-10-29T16:26:43Z\n","    Duration: 2:51\n","    Number of comments: 94\n","    Number of likes: 1465\n","    Number of dislikes: 100\n","    Number of views: 643436\n","    \n","    Title: CBS promo Victor / Victoria 1985\n","    Description: A promo for the 1985 network premiere of Blake Edwards' hit comedy, starring Julie Andrews and James Garner.\n","    Channel Title: robatsea2009\n","    Publish time: 2011-11-17T12:04:10Z\n","    Duration: 54\n","    Number of comments: 4\n","    Number of likes: 15\n","    Number of dislikes: 1\n","    Number of views: 5521\n","    \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    Title: Jessica Bendinger on THE CANDIDATE\n","    Description: http://www.trailersfromhell.com\n","    Channel Title: Trailers From Hell\n","    Publish time: 2015-11-20T03:30:00Z\n","    Duration: 3:45\n","    Number of comments: 0\n","    Number of likes: 22\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 1430\n","    \n","    Title: The Great Race Trailer 1965\n","    Description: The Great Race Trailer 1965\n","Director: Blake Edwards\n","Starring: George Macready, Jack Lemmon, Keenan Wynn, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk, Tony Curtis\n","\n","Official Content From Warner Home Video\n","\n","A dastardly villain, a noble hero, a spirited suffragette and lots Edwards slapstick and silliness are the competitors in a New York to Paris auto race circa 1910.\n","\n","Movie, The Great Race Movie,The Great Race Trailer,The Great Race 1965, Blake Edwards,George Macready, Jack Lemmon, Keenan Wynn, Natalie Wood, Peter Falk, Tony Curtis\n","    Channel Title: Video Detective\n","    Publish time: 2014-10-31T13:08:29Z\n","    Duration: 2:53\n","    Number of comments: 4\n","    Number of likes: 16\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 5417\n","    \n","    Title: Arthur Penn On Directing BONNIE AND CLYDE\n","    Description: Director Arthur Penn talks about Warren Beatty's encouragement to have him direct BONNIE AND CLYDE as well as the experience of making the film and its social impact.\n","\n","AFI FACEBOOK APP:\n","http://apps.facebook.com/afiytapp/\n","\n","CONNECT WITH AFI:\n","http://twitter.com/AmericanFilm\n","http://AFI.com/members\n","http://facebook.com/AmericanFilmInstitute\n","    Channel Title: American Film Institute\n","    Publish time: 2010-09-29T20:37:35Z\n","    Duration: 2:57\n","    Number of comments: 15\n","    Number of likes: 81\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 12708\n","    \n","    Title: Old Man and the Sea, The - (Original Trailer)\n","    Description: Trailer\n","    Channel Title: Вайнах Лига\n","    Publish time: 2013-03-30T19:02:07Z\n","    Duration: 1:44\n","    Number of comments: 6\n","    Number of likes: 214\n","    Number of dislikes: 31\n","    Number of views: 111414\n","    \n","    Title: Dial M for Murder (1954) trailer\n","    Description: Trailer from Dial M for Murder (1954), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings\n","    Channel Title: MovieTitles\n","    Publish time: 2011-10-26T00:18:00Z\n","    Duration: 2:36\n","    Number of comments: 9\n","    Number of likes: 52\n","    Number of dislikes: 4\n","    Number of views: 21933\n","    \n","    Title: Dirty Dancing (1987) Official Trailer  - Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey Movie HD\n","    Description: Subscribe to CLASSIC TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u43jDe\n","Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\n","Subscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\n","Like us on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/1QyRMsE\n","Follow us on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/1ghOWmt\n","Dirty Dancing (1987) Official Trailer  - Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey Movie HD\n","\n","Spending the summer in a holiday camp with her family, Frances \"Baby\" Houseman falls in love with the camp's dance instructor Johnny Castle.\n","\n","Welcome to the Fandango MOVIECLIPS Trailer Vault Channel.

The story looks at what happens before and after (but not during) a botched jewelry store robbery organized by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and enjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he's grateful for the work but isn't the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who's the rat? What do they do about Mr. Blonde? And what do they do with Mr. Orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is slowly bleeding to death? Reservoir Dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, occasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of tipping, who starred in Get Christie Love!, and what to do when you enter a men's room full of cops carrying a briefcase full of marijuana.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Lionsgate (1992)\n","Cast: Kirk Baltz, Edward Bunker, Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, Quentin Tarantino, Lawrence Tierney\n","Director: Quentin Tarantino\n","Producers: Lawrence Bender, Richard N.

One day Jacques' father, who was a diver too, died in the mediterranean sea. After that incident Enzo and Jacques lost contact. After several years, Enzo and Jacques had grown up, Johanna, a young clerk in a security office, has to go to Peru. There she meets Jacques who works for a group of scientist. He dives for some minutes into ice cold water and the scientist monitor his physical state that is more like a dolphin's than a human's. Johanna can not believe what she sees and gets very interested in Jacques but she's unable to get acquainted with him. Some weeks later, back in her office, she notices a championship for divers that is supposed to take place in Taormina, Italy. In order to see Jacques again she makes up a story so the firm sends her to Italy for business purposes. In Taormina there is also Enzo, the reigning diving world champion. He knows that only Jacques can challenge and probably beat him. This time Johanna and Jacques get closer, but Jacques, being more a dolphin than a man, can not really commit and his rivalry with Enzo pushes both man into dangerous territory... \n","\n","Genre:Action/Thriller\n","Director:Luc Besson\n","Cast:Rosanna Arquette, Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno\n","    Channel Title: FilmTrailersChannel\n","    Publish time: 2009-08-14T17:14:50Z\n","    Duration: 1:51\n","    Number of comments: 59\n","    Number of likes: 415\n","    Number of dislikes: 25\n","    Number of views: 312648\n","    \n","    Title: RAN - Official Trailer - Directed by Akira Kurosawa\n","    Description: The final masterpiece from legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, RAN, is Kurosawa’s meditation on Shakespeare’s King Lear crossed with the history of Japan’s 16th century Civil Wars and the legend of Morikawa, a feudal warlord with three sons.\n","\n","Rediscover The Classic: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ran-Digitally-remastered-Tatsuya-Nakadai/dp/B01G3Q5VEO/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=RAN&qid=1562161112&s=gateway&sr=8-1\n","    Channel Title: StudiocanalUK\n","    Publish time: 2016-02-26T12:00:01Z\n","    Duration: 1:4\n","    Number of comments: 290\n","    Number of likes: 5020\n","    Number of dislikes: 85\n","    Number of views: 558972\n","    \n","    Title: The Killer / Dip huet seung hung (1989) Trailer\n","    Description: The Killer / Dip huet seung hung (1989) Trailer\n","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097202/\n","Director: John Woo\n","Yun-Fat Chow, Danny Lee, Sally Yeh, Kong Chu\n","    Channel Title: Danios12345\n","    Publish time: 2009-09-04T13:04:39Z\n","    Duration: 2:11\n","    Number of comments: 4\n","    Number of likes: 52\n","    Number of dislikes: 1\n","    Number of views: 27556\n","    \n","    Title: Psicosis - Psycho - 1960 - Trailer 50to Anniversario - HD | CineCartelera.com.ar\n","    Description: Trailer de Psicosis (Psycho) de 1960, protagonizada por Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh.

Simply put, the heroes involved have been ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, headed by Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers are denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; as in armies past and future, they are given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. Still, none of the soldiers quit the regiment when given the chance. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit themselves valiantly at Fort Wagner, SC, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. Glory was based on Lincoln Kirstein's Lay This Laurel and Peter Burchard's One Gallant Rush; the latter book was founded on the letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the real-life character played by Matthew Broderick. The film won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for co-star Denzel Washington, and additional statuettes for Best Cinematography (Freddie Francis) and Sound Recording.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Sony (1989)\n","Cast: Matthew Broderick\n","Director: Edward Zwick\n","Producers: Pieter Jan Brugge, Sarah Caplan, Freddie Fields, P.K.

Engaged in battle against Germany's Field Marshal Rommel, Patton drives back \"The Desert Fox\" by using the German's own tactics. Promoted to Lieutenant General, Patton is sent to Sicily, where he engages in a personal war of egos with British Field Marshal Montgomery. Performing brilliantly in Italy, Patton seriously jeopardizes his future with a single slap. While touring an Army hospital, the General comes across a GI suffering from nervous fatigue. Incensed by what he considers a slacker, Patton smacks the poor soldier and orders him to get well in a hurry. This incident results in his losing his command-and, by extension, missing out on D-Day. In his final campaign, Patton leads the US 3rd Army through Europe. Unabashedly flamboyant, Patton remains a valuable resource, but ultimately proves too much of a \"loose cannon\" in comparison to the more level-headed tactics of his old friend Omar Bradley.\n","    Channel Title: Michael Appert\n","    Publish time: 2011-06-05T05:27:28Z\n","    Duration: 4:39\n","    Number of comments: 211\n","    Number of likes: 1101\n","    Number of dislikes: 70\n","    Number of views: 661165\n","    \n","    Title: Three Reasons: Down by Law\n","    Description: Those are our three reasons.

Up to her neck in vitriol and sick of it, popular teenager Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder, Edward Scissorhands) finds herself in a tiresome tide of ins and outs, part of a cruel social clique so wrapped up in their own making that no one else stands a chance. She decides to challenge the malevolent rule of the self-appointed divas of the school scene, the Heathers (Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker), and begins a torrid journey of blackmail, sex, revenge and murder. With the aid of rebellious newcomer Jason Dean (Christian Slater, True Romance) Veronica is set to revolutionise the classroom and turn popular perception upside down. Heathers, the original '80s cult classic, returns us to a time of 'swatch dogs', 'diet coke heads' and a bunch of croquet playing queen bees that will have you laughing to the last despicable gasp.

Gary Oldman's metamorphosis as Dracula who grows from old to young, from man to beast is nothing short of amazing. Winona Ryder brings equal intensity to the role of a young beauty who becomes the object of Dracula's devastating desire. Anthony Hopkins co-stars as the famed doctor who dares to believe in Dracula, and then dares to confront him. Opulent, dazzling and utterly irresistible, this is Dracula as you've never seen him.

Warm and cozy inside their palatial villa, Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon), Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton), and Shelley's wife Mary (Elsa Lanchester) engage in morbidly sparkling conversation. The wicked Byron mockingly chastises Mary for frightening the literary world with her recent novel Frankenstein, but Mary insists that her horror tale preached a valuable moral, that man was not meant to dabble in the works of God. Moreover, Mary adds that her story did not end with the death of Frankenstein's monster, whereupon she tells the enthralled Byron and Shelley what happened next. Surviving the windmill fire that brought the original 1931 Frankenstein to a close, the Monster (Boris Karloff) quickly revives and goes on another rampage of death and destruction. Meanwhile, his ailing creator Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) discovers that his former mentor, the demented Doctor Praetorius (Ernst Thesiger), plans to create another life-sized monster -- this time a woman! After a wild and wooly \"creation\" sequence, the bandages are unwrapped, and the Bride of the Monster (Elsa Lanchester again) emerges. Alas, the Monster's tender efforts to connect with his new Mate are rewarded only by her revulsion and hoarse screams. \"She hate me,\" he growls, \"Just like others!\" Wonderfully acted and directed, The Bride of Frankenstein is further enhanced by the vivid Franz Waxman musical score; even the film's occasional lapses in logic and continuity (it was trimmed from 90 to 75 minutes after the first preview) are oddly endearing. Director James Whale was memorably embodied by Ian McKellen in the Oscar-winning 1998 biopic Gods and Monsters.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Universal (1935)\n","Cast: Colin Clive, Boris Karloff, Ernest Thesiger, Valerie Hobson, Elsa Lanchester\n","Director: James Whale\n","Producer: Carl Laemmle Jr.\n","Screenwriters: John L.

I personally love this movie, and therefore I got the trailer and batched it to HD quality. I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made, i got the orginal DVD, and i promise you.. It´s worth buying. I´ll give it 6 stars.. It´s brilliant acting, great plot.. I´ve seen it 20 times +, and I´ll never stop watching it.\n","\n","Donnie Brasco is an Academy Awardnominated 1997 film by Mike Newell, starring Al Pacino, Michael Madsen and Johnny Depp. It is loosely based on the real-life events of Joseph D. Pistone, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who successfully infiltrated the Bonanno crime family, one of the Mafia's Five Families based in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias \"Donnie Brasco\". Depp met with Pistone several times while preparing for his role.\n","\n","In the late 1970s, FBI agent Joe Pistone (Depp) is assigned to infiltrate the New York Citybased Bonanno crime family. Calling himself, \"Donnie Brasco\" and posing as a diamond expert from Vero Beach, Florida, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino), a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters, and Dominick \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano (Madsen). Lefty can't seem to make any money, his son is a drug-addict and he is continually passed over for promotion to a higher position within the crime family. He continually reminds Brasco of his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years in the Mafia (and killing 26 people), with little to show for it. In Donnie, however, Lefty sees a young protégé who might be able to succeed where he had failed. He takes Donnie under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly becomes accepted by the other Family members, although he is never elevated above the rank of \"associate\" member (the lowest mafia rank). But the longer Pistone plays the role of a gangster, the more he finds himself actually becoming Donnie Brasco during his rare off duty hours. His change in personality drives a wedge between him and his wife (played by Anne Heche) and three children. Over time, Pistone comes to realize that the slightest mistake in his performance as a mobster could result in the death of him and his family. In addition, Joe Pistone has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend. He knows that when the day finally comes that the FBI arrests his mob associates, he will be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he himself had killed him.\n","\n","The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Adapted Screenplay\n","\n","Johnny Depp - Joseph Pistone/Donnie Brasco \n","Al Pacino - Benjamin Ruggiero \n","Michael Madsen - Sonny Black \n","Bruno Kirby - Nicholas Santora \n","Anne Heche - Maggie Pistone \n","James Russo - John Cersani \n","Zeljko Ivanek - Tim Curley \n","Jack Rann - Dean Blandford \n","Andrew Parks - Hollman \n","Robert Miano - Sonny Red \n","Brian Tarantina - Anthony Indelicato \n","Rocco Sisto - Richard 'Richie' Gazzo \n","\n","Directed by: Mike Newell \n","Produced by: Alan Greenspan, Patrick McCormick \n","Written by: Paul Attanasio \n","Release date: 28 February 1997 \n","Language: English \n","\n","(Source: Wikipedia)\n","\n","Enjoy.\n","Regards,\n","ArtZith\n","    Channel Title: ArtZith\n","    Publish time: 2009-01-28T14:13:31Z\n","    Duration: 2:11\n","    Number of comments: 45\n","    Number of likes: 249\n","    Number of dislikes: 22\n","    Number of views: 306553\n","    \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    Title: Milo Ventimiglia : Must Be The Music 1/2\n","    Description: Boy Life 2 (1997) Must Be The Music\n","    Channel Title: Ninemyne\n","    Publish time: 2010-04-03T23:41:20Z\n","    Duration: 10:1\n","    Number of comments: 29\n","    Number of likes: 489\n","    Number of dislikes: 24\n","    Number of views: 113525\n","    \n","    Title: City of Industry Trailer [HD]\n","    Description: No Copyright Infringement Intended.\n","    Channel Title: MoviemanTrailers\n","    Publish time: 2011-08-10T12:01:17Z\n","    Duration: 1:3\n","    Number of comments: 0\n","    Number of likes: 10\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 10847\n","    \n","    Title: Best Men Trailer 1998\n","    Description: Best Men Trailer 1998\n","Starring: Drew Barrymore, Dean Cain, Andy Dick, Sean Patrick Flanery, Mitchell Whitfield, Luke Wilson\n","\n","Official Content From Orion Home Video\n","\n","\n","\n","Movie, Best Men Movie,Best Men Trailer,Best Men 1998, Drew Barrymore, Dean Cain, Andy Dick, Sean Patrick Flanery, Mitchell Whitfield, Luke Wilson\n","    Channel Title: Video Detective\n","    Publish time: 2014-12-05T12:29:44Z\n","    Duration: 35\n","    Number of comments: 1\n","    Number of likes: 14\n","    Number of dislikes: 1\n","    Number of views: 6005\n","    \n","    Title: Jungle 2 Jungle Movie Trailer 1997 - Tim Allen\n","    Description: #1997movietrailer #trailers #trailer #movietrailer #previews\n","Find More @ #cappazack\n","\n","TV Trailer -https://youtu.be/wnxKZWYc3dY\n","https://youtu.be/bvlnyaLLKnc\n","Trailer\n","https://youtu.be/7uQm7SOJymg\n","\n","#timallen\n","\n","Movie Trailer for 1997 comedy Tim Allen\n","also with:\n","Martin Short\n","Lolita Davidovich\n","David Ogden Stiers\n","JoBeth Williams\n","and Sam Huntington\n","\n","\n","PLAYLISTS OF #CAPPAZACK\n","Movie Studio Themes\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTtknAGYgI&list=PLvwH9mvgvpARfyxmH1uTN6l2jOHtiGuEZ\n","1990’s Movie Trailers - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPPuc-XYvH0&list=PLvwH9mvgvpARDxHJy0s8LlgTbkvhREMz-\n","1990’s Movie Trailers – TV Spots - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_18TLoKG6E&list=PLvwH9mvgvpATkQMgBPcWWwevyXdJIO-xr\n","2000’s Movie Trailers - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCjiNBiEUaQ&list=PLvwH9mvgvpAScVUn0qDi1sODi45RUIu7A\n","2000’s Movie Trailers – TV Spots\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpvPzsBZBh4&list=PLvwH9mvgvpARLKyZDmpBr016IRZaDxdbS \n","2010’s Movie Trailers\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFyB8N1AgWg&list=PLvwH9mvgvpASQw6R-ZYVqV_oATPVHjf5f\n","TV & Video Misc\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcnKd4pScKs&list=PLvwH9mvgvpARb8bn3rjO062pogqWYMjHw \n","TV Show Themes\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2YJGMS8FHU&list=PLvwH9mvgvpASojZ7oTBOFX0xnlTT9hYBw \n","Classic Movie Trailers\n","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b8CaVvPCR8&list=PLvwH9mvgvpASWJIx8N_DZdaqy475UDYnF \n","\n","\n","Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Ben Affleck stars as Holden McNeil, a New Jersey comic book writer who is roommates with his best friend and professional partner, artist Banky Edwards (Jason Lee). Their hit comic book series, \"Bluntman and Chronic,\" is loosely patterned after a pair of acquaintances, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Smith), two characters already familiar as supporting players in several Smith films. Into Holden's life comes Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), a lesbian and fellow comic book creator who quickly becomes a close friend, although Holden is powerfully attracted to her. Eventually, Alyssa realizes that she is attracted to Holden as well and they begin a physical relationship, much to the consternation of Banky, whose ire over losing his best friend to a lesbian seems to border on romantic jealousy. After he learns something about Alyssa's sexual past, however, Holden's immature response to his new knowledge destroys both his romance with Alyssa and his friendship with Banky. Chasing Amy (1997) was the third film in what Smith referred to as his \"New Jersey series,\" films set at least partly in the Garden State and featuring the Jay and Silent Bob characters.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Miramax Films (1997)\n","Cast: Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Joey Lauren Adams, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith\n","Director: Kevin Smith\n","Producers: Robert Hawk, Scott Mosier, John Pierson, Derrick Tseng\n","Screenwriter: Kevin Smith\n","\n","WHO ARE WE?\n","The MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

SPOILERS IN DESCRIPTION!\n","\n","Directed By: Jim Gillespie\n","Starring: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Johnny Galecki, Bridgette Wilson, Anne Heche, Muse Watson\n","\n","Plot:\n","The night of their high school graduation, Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan Philippe) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr) go out of town to celebrate. Returning in Barry's new car, they hit and apparently kill a man. They dump the corpse in the ocean and agree to never discuss again what had happened.\n","One year later Julie is returning home from college. She has not spoken with Helen, Barry or Ray since the accident. Julie receives a letter that reads \"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!\" Julie goes to see Helen's sister Elsa (Bridgette Wilson), who tells Julie that Helen has been working there. Julie shows Helen the letter and they decide to visit Barry. After going over the incident, Barry accuses Max. The three of them go to see Max, but Barry insists on going in the factory alone. Barry persuades Max to go into the back room and attacks him, telling Max he should keep his mouth shut. Julie finds Ray working on the docks. Ray tries to make up with Julie but she runs off. Inside the factory Max is murdered by someone wielding a hook. The killer attacks Barry next, running him over with Barry's car. The killer is shown wearing a raincoat and wielding a hook on one hand.\n","Julie arrives at the hospital to see Barry and finds Helen and Ray there. Julie reveals the man they hit was named David Eagen. Helen and Julie track his sister, Missy (Anne Heche), to her home, where she has been living since her brother's death. Missy does not recognise them and Julie is convinced she is innocent. Missy tells them she had a visit from a man claiming to be David's friend named Billy Blue.\n","At Helen's home that night, the killer breaks in, hiding in her closet. The next morning Helen wakes up with most of her hair cut to bits and \"SOON\" written in lipstick on her mirror. Julie gets a call from Barry, who tells her to come to Helen's. On the way, Julie hears rattling in her trunk. She opens the trunk to find Max's body. She shuts the trunk, runs to Helen's and brings her and Barry to her car, but the body has disappeared. Julie is convinced the killer took the body and they are not safe. Later they run into Ray, who tells them he got a letter. Julie decides to see Missy again while Helen and Barry watch each other's backs at the parade. Julie tries to convince Missy that David did not kill himself after Missy presents her with a suicide note written in the same style as her letter from the killer. Missy tells Julie to leave.\n","At the Croaker pageant, Helen sees Barry murdered by the killer. However, neither the killer nor the body are found afterwards. A police officer drives her home, but the killer lures the cop into an alley and kills him. Helen runs to her store where Elsa is working, but the killer finds and murders both of them.\n","Julie learns that the killer is Ben Willis, a fisherman. He murdered David Egan after David and Ben's daughter Susie were involved in a car crash near where the four teenagers hit Ben. Susie was killed in the accident and David was unharmed. Ben blamed David and killed him a year later, making it look like a suicide. On the way home, Ben was hit by the group.\n","Julie goes to see Ray on his boat and tells him the story, but he does not believe her. Julie notices the name on his boat is \"Billy Blue\" and accuses him of the murders. He chases her but is knocked unconscious by a man who tells Julie to get on his boat. After she does, she learns he is Ben Willis. She is chased all over the boat while Ray regains consciousness and steals a boat to save Julie. In a room full of ice, Julie finds Helen and Barry's bodies. Ray climbs aboard and is almost killed by Ben, but is caught in the boat's net. He climbs back aboard and saves Julie. Ben gets his hand caught in a rope and Ray hoists him into the air where his hand is cut off and he falls into the ocean. On land, Ray tells Julie the reason he went to see Missy was because he was guilty and had to know who they hit. He tells her he loves her and they embrace. Ben's body is not recovered.\n","A year later, Julie is in her second year and is going on a trip to New York with Ray. She receives a letter resembling the one she had got from Ben, but it only contains a pool party invitation. Julie returns to the bathroom, which has filled with steam. On the shower door, \"I STILL KNOW\" is written. Ben jumps through the shower door, attacking her.\n","    Channel Title: trailermanishere\n","    Publish time: 2010-06-22T09:49:41Z\n","    Duration: 2:19\n","    Number of comments: 674\n","    Number of likes: 3269\n","    Number of dislikes: 154\n","    Number of views: 1446278\n","    \n","    Title: Devil's Advocate (1997) Official Trailer - Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves Drama Movie HD\n","    Description: Subscribe to CLASSIC TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u43jDe\n","Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\n","Subscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\n","Like us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\n","Follow us on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/1ghOWmt \n","Devil's Advocate (1997) Official Trailer - Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves Drama Movie HD\n","\n","\n","An exceptionally adept Florida lawyer is offered a job to work in New York City for a high-end law firm with a high-end boss - the biggest opportunity of his career to date.\n","\n","Welcome to the Fandango MOVIECLIPS Trailer Vault Channel.

The cast includes Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, as well as Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone. The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast 24-hours-a-day to billions of people across the globe. Truman becomes suspicious of his perceived reality and embarks on a quest to discover the truth about his life.\n","\n","The genesis of The Truman Show was a spec script by Niccol. The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Scott Rudin purchased the script, and instantly set the project up at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was in contention to direct before Weir took over, managing to make the film for $60 million against the estimated $80 million budget. Niccol rewrote the script simultaneously as the filmmakers were waiting for Carrey's schedule to open up for filming.

Ruthless arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), who lives with perpetually stoned beach-babe Melanie (Bridget Fonda), teams with his old buddy Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), just released from prison after serving four years for armed robbery. ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) bust stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), who was smuggling money into the country for Ordell. Ordell springs Jackie, but when middle-aged bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) picks her up at the jail, he's attracted to her, and they choose a romantic route with detours. Mistrust and suspicions surface after Jackie pits Ordell and the cops against each other, convincing Ordell that she's going to double-cross the cops. Tarantino commented on the film's budget: \"Jackie Brown only cost $12 million. You can't lose. You absolutely, positively can't lose. And you don't have to compromise.\"\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Miramax Films (1997)\n","Cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L.

The Lenders are forced to move, and the Clocks face the risk of being exposed to the normal-sized world.\n","\n","Universal - 1997\n","    Channel Title: Movieclips Classic Trailers\n","    Publish time: 2012-01-10T07:16:16Z\n","    Duration: 1:31\n","    Number of comments: 245\n","    Number of likes: 2298\n","    Number of dislikes: 110\n","    Number of views: 714653\n","    \n","    Title: I love you don't touch me\n","    Description: Katie is a 25-year-old virgin living in Los Angeles.

Entstanden aus dem \"Duke Ellington\"-Projekt des Jazzorchesters der Kölner Musikhochschule hatte die Band nach ihrer Gründung im Frühjahr 1996 einen ungewöhnliche erfolgreichen Start. Im April 1996 nahm die Band auf Einladung von Manfred Schoof an dessen Geburtstagskonzert in der Philharmonie Köln teil, und spielte mit Rob Pronk, Ali Haurand, Gerd Dudek, Gunther Hampel und Markus Stockhausen (TV-Aufzeichnung WDR: \"Manfred Schoof - Weggefährten\").\n","Das Orchester hat unter der Leitung von Stefan Pfeifer bei Projekten mit Gastsolisten wie u.a. Conte Candoli, Ack van Rooyen, Al Porcino, Dick Oates, Ferdinand Povel, Heinz von Hermann, Silvia Droste, Andy Haderer, Jörg-Achim Keller, Jiggs Whigham und Ed Partyka sein hohes Niveau und seine musikalische Flexibilität unter Beweis gestellt. Die Mitglieder des Orchesters sind ausnahmslos hervorragende professionelle Musiker, die sowohl als Solisten wie als Sidemen in den unterschiedlichsten Bereichen der Musik erfolgreich tätig sind.\n","Das umfangreiche Bandbook umfasst unter anderem Arrangements von Bill Holman, Bob Florence, John Clayton, Don Menza, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Stan Kenton, Maynard Ferguson, Francy Boland, Jerry van Rooyen und Rob Pronk ebenso wie Musik aus den Reihen der Band. Dieses Repertoire, interpretiert mit der Leidenschaft, der Perfektion und dem mitreißenden Swing einer glänzend eingespielten Band mit ihren herausragenden Solisten, macht den Sound der \"Big Band Convention\" aus.\n","Das Orchester begann seine Konzerte 1996 zunächst im Stadtgarten in Köln und setzte diese mit großem Erfolg zwischen 1998 und 2003 im Rheinländer in Köln fort. Dort entstand auch die CD \"Live At The Rheinländer Cologne 2001\". Nach weiteren Stationen im Kunstsalon, Altenberger Hof, Subway und im Bogen 2 in der Hohenzollernbrücke in Köln spielt \"The Big Band Convention\" im Klub Berlin, Keplerstr. 4, 50823 Köln\n","Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter \n","\n","http://bigbandconvention.de\n","    Channel Title: Rheinländer-TV\n","    Publish time: 2015-10-13T23:46:56Z\n","    Duration: 3:30\n","    Number of comments: 0\n","    Number of likes: 0\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 225\n","    \n","    Title: Kissing A Fool Trailer [HQ]\n","    Description: No Copyright Infringement Intended.\n","    Channel Title: MoviemanTrailers\n","    Publish time: 2012-07-17T11:44:39Z\n","    Duration: 2:5\n","    Number of comments: 1\n","    Number of likes: 33\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 20695\n","    \n","    Title: Mr Nice Guy Trailer\n","    Description: Very Good Movie\n","    Channel Title: KenLJones\n","    Publish time: 2008-03-29T00:40:53Z\n","    Duration: 31\n","    Number of comments: 18\n","    Number of likes: 71\n","    Number of dislikes: 8\n","    Number of views: 189775\n","    \n","    Title: Trailer for \"Taste of Cherry\"\n","    Description: Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) drives around Tehran in hopes of finding someone willing to burry him after he commits suicide.

Henry fancies himself a gifted writer whose \"Confessions\" will set the literary world ablaze, and encourages the tongue-tied Simon to express himself through writing.

With another asteroid \"the size of Texas\" en route, a plan is devised to send oil drillers to land on the asteroid and drop a nuclear device down a 1000-foot shaft, a scheme calculated to crack the asteroid into two halves, saving Earth. NASA begins a crash program to train beer-besotted oil roughnecks for the mission. During a stopover to refuel at the Mir Station, the space station is accidentally destroyed, so a Russian cosmonaut also joins the team.

Czarnina (duck blood soup) although very popular until the 19th century is rarely eaten now. Kielbasa (sausage), especially cooked is rarely consumed for breakfast, while each meal in the movie contains it. Music played in the film is of Balcan origin. Procession of the Virgin and selection of a virgin to lead it does not happen in the Polish Roman Catholic church. The movie plays off a number of inaccurate stereotypes. Obsession over a large number of offspring is perhaps a 19th century phenomenon, while smoking and shouting at the table are not accepted in Polish culture.\n","    Channel Title: katerinaao\n","    Publish time: 2009-07-19T20:06:32Z\n","    Duration: 1:29\n","    Number of comments: 30\n","    Number of likes: 96\n","    Number of dislikes: 14\n","    Number of views: 95980\n","    \n","    Title: 5 Minute Features: This World, Then the Fireworks\n","    Description: Here is volume 2 of the 5 Minute Feature Film series, this time on Michael Oblowitz's adaptation of Jim Thompson's This World, Then the Fireworks. The 5 Minute Feature Film series is where I take a full length movie and cut it down to 5 minutes in length, re-score it, but tell basically the same story, while simultaneously analyzing the film. You can find part one here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYM7mmakRrs&context=C459aeb4ADvjVQa1PpcFMYs4RUQYrgcQmwA2q_KX0ht3SFhm2Sq-k=, where I made a 5 minute version of the Nicolas Cage/Nicole Kidman vehicle Trespass.\n","\n","This World, Then the Fireworks, starring Billy Zane, Gina Gershon, Sheryl Lee, and Rue McClanahan, is a very post-modern look at film noir, like a David Lynch film, but with less consistency of vision (I uploaded the original EPK for the film on Youtube which hammers that point even more). I reviewed the film here: http://regrettablesincerity.com/?p=8458 , and by reading that piece, you'll understand my editing choices. What's most interesting is that because of Oblowitz's style, and how it would eventually completely reveal itself on the two Steven Seagal DTV movies he made (Out for a Kill and The Foreigner), the opening montage of This World, Then the Fireworks which sets up the tone of the film and the entire story, is practically incoherent. It's cut so quickly and in such a flashy manner that there's very little way to take in the important information, so, despite cutting a 100 minute film down to 5 minutes, I actually had to slow down the opening montage to make sure you could understand what was going on. The rest of the movie is less rushed, though it still has a twitchy nature to it, and my editing was aided by the broad performances and theatrical gestures by Zane, Gershon, and especially Lee.\n","\n","The music you'll hear in this Five Minute Feature is from Tchaikovsky's Symphony Pathetique and Django Reinhardt's Bouncin' Around.\n","    Channel Title: StElmosOxygen\n","    Publish time: 2012-04-17T19:53:31Z\n","    Duration: 4:42\n","    Number of comments: 18\n","    Number of likes: 23\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 8919\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    \n","    Title: Metropolis (restoration trailer)\n","    Description: http://www.kino.com/metropolis/\n","Metropolis is a 1927 silent science fiction film directed by Fritz Lang and written by Lang and Thea von Harbou. Lang and von Harbou, who were married, wrote the screenplay in 1924, and the story was novelized by von Harbou in 1926. It is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and examines a common science fiction theme of the day: the social crisis between workers and owners in capitalism. The film stars Alfred Abel as the leader of the city, Gustav Fröhlich as his son, who tries to mediate between the elite caste and the workers, Brigitte Helm as both the pure-at-heart worker Maria and the debased robot version of her, and Rudolf Klein-Rogge as the mad scientist who created the robot.\n","\n","Metropolis was produced in Germany in the Babelsberg Studios by Universum Film A.G. (UFA) and released in 1927 during a stable period of the Weimar Republic. The most expensive film of its time, it cost approximately 7 million Reichsmark to make. The film was cut substantially after its German premiere, and there have been several efforts to restore it. Also, the American copyright lapsed in 1953, which eventually led to a proliferation of versions being released on video.\n","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(film)\n","    Channel Title: Humanoidity\n","    Publish time: 2009-04-29T03:32:06Z\n","    Duration: 2:38\n","    Number of comments: 265\n","    Number of likes: 1272\n","    Number of dislikes: 32\n","    Number of views: 528654\n","    \n","    Title: Back to the Future Part 2 Official Trailer #1 - Michael J.

Banidas há 300 anos devido à prática de feitiçaria, elas estão dispostas a tudo para garantir sua juventude e imortalidade. Porém precisarão enfrentar três crianças e um gato falante, que podem atrapalhar seus planos.\n","\n","Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy  romp around like coked-up versions of The Three Stooges in the frantic Disney romp Hocus Pocus. The film begins in 1693 where three witches -- Winifred (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary (Kathy Najimy) -- are preparing a potion that will grant them immortality and eternal youth. But before they finish mixing their cocktail, the people of Salem capture them and execute them for practicing witchcraft. Before their deaths, they vow to return to Salem 300 years hence on Halloween to exact their revenge. Three hundred years later, a skeptical, newly transplanted Californian, Max (Omri Katz), explores the ruins of the legendary witches' house and dares the witches to manifest themselves. Disregarding the warnings of his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and girlfriend Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max lights the Candle of Black Flame. With that, the witches reappear to wreak havoc on the town. The kids take off with the witches' spellbook and a musty tome of hexes and recipes. The sorceresses, who will die by the morning light if they don't recite the incantation for immortality, have to get the books by whatever means they can.

Segar (and less on the animated cartoons created by Max Fleischer, which were decidedly different in tone and approach), Popeye follows the sailor man with the mighty arms (played by Robin Williams in his first major film role) as he arrives in the seaside community of Sweethaven in search of his long-lost father. Popeye meets and quickly falls for the slender Olive Oyl (Shelley Duvall, in the role she was born to play), but Olive's hand has already been promised to the hulking Bluto (Paul Smith), of whom Olive can say little except, well, he's large. Eventually, Popeye and Olive are brought together by Swee' Pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt), an adorable foundling, and Popeye finally meets his dad, Poopdeck Pappy (Ray Walston). Director Robert Altman in no way tempered his trademark style for this big-budget family opus, crowding the screen with a variety of characters and allowing his cast to overlap as much dialogue as they want.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Paramount (1980)\n","Cast: Paul Dooley, Ray Walston, Robin Williams, Shelley Duvall, Wesley Ivan Hurt\n","Director: Robert Altman\n","Producers: Scott Bushnell, C.O.

Its lighthearted approach aside, the film is faithful enough to its grisly pulp fiction roots that certain scenes (like a bloodthirsty high priest burrowing into an unlucky native’s chest to pluck out his heart) heralded the new PG-13 rating from the MPAA.\n","\n","As always, you can find more commentary, more reviews, more podcasts, and more deep-dives into the films you don't know you love yet over on the Trailers From Hell mothership: \n","\n","http://www.trailersfromhell.com\n","\n","Check out our podcast, THE MOVIES THAT MADE ME, where you can join Oscar-nominated screenwriter Josh Olson and TFH Fearless Leader Joe Dante in conversation with filmmakers, comedians, and all-around interesting people about the movies that made them who they are.

Goyer adaptation of the Marvel Comics character created in 1973 by scripter Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan. In the Tomb of Dracula comic book origin, just before Blade's mother gave birth to Blade, she was bitten by a vampire, which made Blade immune to vampires. Now a vampire hunter, Blade, joined by vampire detective Hannibal King and Dracula-descendent Frank Drake, stalks vampires. In the 1990s (in Marvel's Nightstalkers), Blade teamed with Drake and King in an agency created to fight a variety of supernatural beings. The Marvel origin is retold in this 1998 Norrington film, with Blade's mother dying as he is born. Thirty-some years later, Blade now exists somewhere between the two worlds, not human but not fully vampire. He has become a relentless and superhuman vampire hunter, out to avenge the death of his mother and protect the rest of humankind from the evil vampire race. In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). Blade magically appears at the hospital just in time to whisk Karen to his hideaway, a machine-shop run by his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who once rescued Blade and who now produces a antidote to keep Blade from turning into a full-fledged vampire and who builds custom weapons for Blade to use against his evil foes. Meanwhile, Blade's vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Warner Bros.

In it Daniel plays Henderson Dores, an uptight English art dealer who's transplanted himself to NYC and is doing his level best to embrace the American way of life. When his boss sends him to the American south to acquire a rare painting from Loomis Gage (Harry Dean Stanton), he must contend not only with the eccentric Gage but his entire wacko family. In this scene, Gage's daughter Cora (Glenne Headly) gives Henderson a piece of her mind - and he learns that looks are deceiving.\n","\n","Stars and Bars was NOT warmly received upon its release, and it's a shame, since it appears to have scared Daniel off from trying his hand at comedy again. The film is by no means great, but Daniel's performance has a number of genuinely funny moments.

For 40 years Lilian Singer has been locked up in a mental hospital by her father. Left to her own devices she has lived in a world of torment and despair completely shut off from the outside world. When Lilian's release is eventually secured by her eccentric Aunt Kitty and her brother John, she faces the great unknown and embraces it with passion and courage. Searching the streets of Sydney for the essence of love and affection she never received herself, Lilian's journey becomes one of self-realisation and underlying contentment. Explored through a series of moving flashbacks her story unfolds with a colourful rainbow of characters that rest between the dark clouds of her past. With outstanding dual performances from Toni Collette (in an AFI award winning performance) and Ruth Cracknell as Lilian, and supported by Barry Otto (Bliss) and John Flaus (Newsfront) Lilian's Story is both inspirational and rewarding.\n","    Channel Title: Umbrella Entertainment\n","    Publish time: 2014-11-28T03:34:29Z\n","    Duration: 3:5\n","    Number of comments: 4\n","    Number of likes: 16\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 7286\n","    \n","    Title: Six String Samurai (1998) Theatrical Trailer\n","    Description: Vegas Needs A New King.\n","\n","All Superheroes Wear Glasses...\n","\n","Theatrical trailer for the 1998 cult classic \"Six String Samurai\".

Edward is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim. Supporting roles are portrayed by Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin.\n","Burton conceived the idea for Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Caroline Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox, after Warner Bros. passed on the project. Edward Scissorhands was then fast tracked after Burton's success with Batman. Before Depp's casting, the leading role of Edward had been connected to Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Robert Downey, Jr., and William Hurt, while the role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and was ultimately his final performance on film.\n","The majority of filming took place in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, which generated over $6 million for the local economy. Edward's scissor hands were created and designed by Stan Winston. The film is also the fourth feature collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman. Edward Scissorhands was released with positive feedback from critics, and was a financial success. The film received numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, Saturn Awards, as well as winning the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work.\n","\n","Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?annot...\n","Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/John-V...\n","Twitter: https://twitter.com/JohnVexer\n","Rating: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487/?ref_=sr_3\n","    Channel Title: JohnVexer\n","    Publish time: 2013-06-08T20:23:31Z\n","    Duration: 2:5\n","    Number of comments: 1017\n","    Number of likes: 13250\n","    Number of dislikes: 377\n","    Number of views: 2913326\n","    \n","    Title: Antz Trailer\n","    Description: Antz is now available on DVD\n","    Channel Title: DreamworksAnimFan\n","    Publish time: 2008-06-03T01:32:26Z\n","    Duration: 2:25\n","    Number of comments: 321\n","    Number of likes: 788\n","    Number of dislikes: 114\n","    Number of views: 767351\n","    \n","    Title: The Impostors Trailer 1999\n","    Description: The Impostors Trailer 1999\n","Starring: Oliver Platt, Stanley Tucci, Teagle F.

He's good at getting himself into trouble...They call him Fletch (Chevy Chase).\n","\n","FILM DESCRIPTION:\n","Chevy Chase added a classic comic hero to the film landscape with Fletch, one of his few truly popular star vehicles in a famously misguided post-Saturday Night Live career. Chase plays Irwin M. Fletcher, known to everyone as Fletch, a Los Angeles Lakers-loving investigative reporter with a gleeful disdain for deadlines and a knack for pushing the buttons of his frustrated editor (Richard Libertini). He's also known for donning numerous disguises and assuming zany false identities to help gain information. While pursuing an ongoing story about a powerful drug dealer who operates from Venice Beach, he comes across an intriguing offshoot in which he becomes intimately involved. Aviation executive Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) has an unusual proposition for Fletch: If Fletch agrees to an elaborate plan to kill him, for reasons Stanwyk refuses to divulge beyond explaining that he has bone cancer, Fletch will walk away with a healthy sum of money and a plane ticket to Brazil. Curious yet suspicious by profession, Fletch begins investigating Stanwyk's true motives, which leads him through numerous misadventures. Among them are a visit to a stuffy country club; a high-speed car chase with an unwitting passenger; repeat encounters with Stanwyk's wife (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), although she may not be his only one; and a trip to Provo -- that's Utah, not Spain. Inspired by a novel of the same name by Gregory McDonald, Fletch went from thriller to comedy as it was adapted into a vehicle for Chase.\n","\n","TM & © Universal (1985)\n","Cast: Joe Don Baker, Chevy Chase, Tim Matheson, M.

LV (Jane Horrocks from Mike Leigh's Life is Sweet who does all her own singing) is a shy, mousy woman living with her mom Mari (Secrets and Lies' Brenda Blethyn). Little Voice doesn't leave her house. Instead she sings along to her record collection of Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland, and Marilyn Monroe. Her mother Mari, however, is an outspoken woman who is convinced her sex appeal (which is little) will land her a man, especially when she's drunk. One night while bar-hopping, Mari meets the suave yet sleazy talent agent Ray Say (Michael Caine), whom she takes home for a nightcap. There Ray hears the beautiful Little Voice singing a perfect rendition of Judy Garland's \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" from The Wizard of Oz. He's stunned by its beauty and thinks he can make her a star. From there the story heads in complicated, romantic, and sweet-hearted directions that should not be given away. Also starring in this small independent film is Ewan McGregor.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Miramax Films (1998)\n","Cast: Michael Caine, Jane Horrocks\n","Director: Mark Herman\n","Producers: Laurie Borg, Elizabeth Karlsen, Nik Powell, Paul Webster, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, Stephen Woolley\n","Screenwriters: Jim Cartwright, Mark Herman\n","\n","WHO ARE WE?\n","The MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

Directed by George Cosmatos, the explosion-happy picture benefits from stellar tech credits with TFH Guru Mark Goldblatt in the editing bay, an evocative score by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from the brilliant Jack Cardiff.\n","\n","As always, you can find more commentary, more reviews, more podcasts, and more deep-dives into the films you don't know you love yet over on the Trailers From Hell mothership: \n","\n","http://www.trailersfromhell.com\n","\n","What's that podcast, you ask?

Efficiently directed by Ted Kotcheff (The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, North Dallas Forty), 1982’s First Blood is the quintessential Reagan era action film; the beleaguered Rambo takes up arms against a corrupt Washington state police department and essentially goes to war with his own government. Andrew Lazlo’s (Southern Comfort, Innerspace) beautiful cinematography (utilizing the lush landscapes of British Columbia) recalls Vilmos Zsigmond’s work on The Deer Hunter and Jerry Goldsmith’s thoughtful score conveys an appropriately manly but melancholy mood.\n","\n","As always, you can find more commentary, more reviews, more podcasts, and more deep-dives into the films you don't know you love yet over on the Trailers From Hell mothership: \n","\n","http://www.trailersfromhell.com\n","\n","What's that podcast, you ask?

Chevy mugs, trips, falls, mashes his fingers and stubs his toes as he prepares to invite numerous dysfunctional relatives to his household to celebrate Christmas. Amidst the more outrageous sight gags (including the electrocution of a cat as the Christmas tree is lit) the film betrays a sentimental streak, with old wounds healing and long-estranged relatives reuniting in the Griswold living room. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was still capable of attracting an audience five years after its release -- it was one of the top-rated seasonal TV specials of 1994, outrating even the first network telecast of It's a Wonderful Life.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Warner Bros.

It is based on a manuscript of the same title written by the film's director, Nora Ephron, in which two letter-writing lovers are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the person with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. The film is a remake of the Ernst Lubitsch film The Shop Around the Corner. (There was also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime starring Judy Garland.) You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly — a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film.\n","\n","The name of the film is an example of product placement, based on the trademark greeting that AOL users hear when they receive new e-mail. About one year later, AOL and Time Warner (the entertainment conglomerate that owns Warner Bros. studios, which released this film) announced a corporate merger.\n","\n","The film received significant media coverage leading up to its release in anticipation of the romantic coupling of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who had appeared together previously in Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993).\n","\n","Plot:\n","Two business rivals hate each other at the office but fall in love over the internet. \n","\n","\n","I do NOT own this video or right to it.

Barry (Tyler Cone) and Sean (John Harrison) meet their fates quickly, but semi-bimbo Heather (Lisa Newmyer) lasts long enough to be tortured and burned before having her head cracked open like a walnut by a mechanical leg. Meanwhile, sweet, befuddled Jenny (Renee Zellweger) actively resists her captors by stealing cars, breaking through windows, and jumping off roofs. Although Leatherface (Robert Jacks), the human skin-wearing transvestite based on real-life serial killer Ed Gein, is back on board, the cannibal cast this time out also includes several new characters, from bionic villain Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) to trashy realtor Darla (Tonie Perensky) and literature-quoting flunky W.E. (Joe Stevens). The plot also adds an X-Files-esque conspiracy to the basic Chainsaw concept in the form of deformed businessman Rothman (James Gale), who descends on the family of killers to critique their torture techniques. Written and directed by original Massacre scribe Kim Henkel, the film appeared at 1995 festivals in a 104-minute cut under the title The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre; after actors Zellweger and McConaughey became Hollywood stars, the film was re-titled, re-cut, and given a limited theatrical release in August of 1997. The nine minutes of deleted footage included scenes of Jenny's troubled home life. Both versions included brief cameos from Marilyn Burns, Paul Partain, and John Dugan -- all of whom appeared in Tobe Hooper's original film. Prodigious litigation preceded the film's re-release, although both the McConaughey and Zellweger camps denied attempting to block its release. The film's soundtrack includes a who's who of local Texas bands.\n","\n","© COLUMBIA / TRISTAR\n","    Channel Title: HORRORF3ST\n","    Publish time: 2009-10-24T09:41:15Z\n","    Duration: 1:45\n","    Number of comments: 201\n","    Number of likes: 196\n","    Number of dislikes: 28\n","    Number of views: 172862\n","    \n","    Title: Ruthless People 1986 TV trailer\n","    Description: A television trailer for the hit 1986 comedy \"Ruthless People\", starring Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Judge Reinhold, Helen Slater, and Bill Pullman.\n","    Channel Title: robatsea2009\n","    Publish time: 2010-09-15T02:40:39Z\n","    Duration: 31\n","    Number of comments: 13\n","    Number of likes: 63\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 63354\n","    \n","    Title: Trailer - Trailer Trick or Treat (1986)\n","    Description: Rock and roll and horror meet head on in this 80s movie about a high school outcast who plays a record backwards and raises the spirit of dead rocker Sammi Curr, who promises to help him get revenge on the school bullies.\n","\n","Treat Movie review:  http://www.steve-calvert.co.uk/movie-reviews/trick-or-treat-1986.htm\n","\n","=========================================================================\n"," Trick or Treat DVD, Soundtrack, T-Shirts, and other Merchandise: https://amzn.to/2qXapne\n","=========================================================================\n","*As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases*\n","    Channel Title: Passion4Horror\n","    Publish time: 2013-09-17T00:47:41Z\n","    Duration: 1:46\n","    Number of comments: 95\n","    Number of likes: 1047\n","    Number of dislikes: 22\n","    Number of views: 125113\n","    \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    Title: Belizaire The Cajun Trailer 1986\n","    Description: Belizaire The Cajun Trailer 1986\n","Director: Glen Pitre\n","Starring: Armand Assante, Gail Youngs, Robert Duvall, Stephen McHattie, Will Patton, Nancy Barrett\n","\n","Official Content From Madacy Home Video\n","\n","Forbidden romance between a faith healer and a well-to-do married Cajun woman in 19th century Louisiana.

The film has always been regarded as a black and white classic when it was nothing of the sort. When audiences originally saw the film in theatres the daylight scenes were in amber, the night in pale blue, the eerie scenes in green and the fiery climax in red. Universal also thought it was necessary to hype the film up a bit. As if the film wasnt scary enough on its own the studio found it in their best interest to park an ambulance out in front of many theatres and to keep two nurses on hand in the lobby to raise the chill factor. They even went as far as to place an actress in the audience during every showing who would, at the scariest moment in the film, scream, jump out of her seat, and run up the aisle and out of the theatre. Too bad we dont see theatrics like that anymore.\n","    Channel Title: RoboJapan\n","    Publish time: 2008-10-01T21:52:48Z\n","    Duration: 1:46\n","    Number of comments: 81\n","    Number of likes: 479\n","    Number of dislikes: 29\n","    Number of views: 310316\n","    \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    Title: The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942) Official Trailer #1 - Cedric Hardwicke Movie\n","    Description: Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\n","Subscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\n","Subscribe to CLASSIC TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u43jDe\n","Like us on FACEBOOK: http://goo.gl/dHs73\n","Follow us on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/1ghOWmt\n","\n","The Ghost of Frankenstein Trailer - Directed by Erle C.

She can -- at least for a while, it seems -- in Notting Hill. William Thacker (played by Hugh Grant) is a bookseller at a shop in the Notting Hill district in West London, who shares a house with an eccentric Welsh friend, Spike (Rhys Ifans). One day, William is minding the store when in strolls Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a lovely and well-known actress from the United States who is in London working on a film. She buys a book from William, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. Their relationship would logically end there, if William didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. While dashing back to the shop, he bumps into Anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. Since he lives nearby, William politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since William seems harmless enough, Anna agrees. When Anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at William's house, they kiss -- just in time for Spike to show up. A romance slowly blooms as his friends and family (not to mention the world at large) wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star.

Starring as the fatally jealous Moor of Venice is Placido Domingo, who had also headlined Zeffirelli's 1976 La Scala staging (production on the film was briefly interrupted while Domingo participated in the rescue operations following the Mexico City earthquake). While Katia Ricciarelli as Desdemona and Justino Diaz as Iago perform their own singing, Zeffirelli's Cassio--played by real-life European prince Urbano Barberini--is dubbed by Ezio de Cesare. The director made several cuts in the original libretto and score in order to accommodate the film's two-hour time limit, but these excisions are done with taste and discretion. Because of the excessive violence in the third act--two murders, a suicide, a superficial throat-slashing--Otello was released with a PG rating.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © MGM (1986)\n","Cast: Plácido Domingo, Justino Díaz, Katia Ricciarelli\n","Director: Franco Zeffirelli\n","Producers: Yoram Globus, Menahem Golan, John Thompson\n","Screenwriters: Arrigo Boito, Franco Zeffirelli, Masolino D'Amico, William Shakespeare\n","\n","WHO ARE WE?\n","The MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

The theme was written by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, and has since been arranged and performed several times by artists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Holly Gornik, and Brynjar Hoff, among others. The theme has been called \"unforgettable\" and a \"celebrated oboe melody\". Vocalist Sarah Brightman begged Morricone to allow her to put lyrics to the theme to create her own song, \"Nella Fantasia\". In 2010, Morricone encouraged soprano Hayley Westenra to write English lyrics for \"Gabriel's Oboe\" in her album Paradiso.\n","The soundtrack for the film was very well received amongst critics, being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score and earning Morricone the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.\n","In the film, the theme is most prominently used when the protagonist, the Jesuit Father Gabriel, walks up to a waterfall and starts playing his oboe, aiming to befriend the natives with his music so he can carry his missionary work in the New World. The Guaraní tribesmen, who have been stalking him from a distance, approach Gabriel for the first time, puzzled by the sounds of the unknown instrument. The chief of the tribe, however, is displeased by this, and breaks Gabriel's oboe. This marks the beginning of the relationship between Father Gabriel and the Guaraní natives.\n","Several orchestras have performed \"Gabriel's Oboe\", often under the direction of Morricone himself. The most famous renditions of the piece, other than in the movie, are probably those found in the Morricone Conducts Morricone series of concerts during the mid-2000s.\n","Keith and Kristyn Getty incorporated the song and blended it with their own verses with lyrics in their 2012 release \"Hymns for the Christian Life\" on track 12 \"Holy Spirit (with Gabriel's Oboe).\"\n","\n","About The Mission, 1986 film (source: Wikipedia)\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","The Mission is a 1986 British drama film about the experiences of a Jesuit missionary in 18th century South America. The film was written by Robert Bolt and directed by Roland Joffé. The movie stars Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi and Liam Neeson. It won the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. In April 2007, it was elected number one on the Church Times's Top 50 Religious Films list. The music, scored by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, was listed at number 23 on the AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores and ranked 1st on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Classic FM Top 100 Music in the Movies.\n","    Channel Title: invreview\n","    Publish time: 2013-06-29T16:55:26Z\n","    Duration: 4:10\n","    Number of comments: 797\n","    Number of likes: 14886\n","    Number of dislikes: 587\n","    Number of views: 4237460\n","    \n","    Title: Trailer   Little Shop of Horrors 1986\n","    Description:  \n","    Channel Title: wormy76\n","    Publish time: 2010-07-23T09:22:27Z\n","    Duration: 2:2\n","    Number of comments: 42\n","    Number of likes: 257\n","    Number of dislikes: 12\n","    Number of views: 123268\n","    \n","    Title: The Little Shop of Horrors (1960) - Trailer\n","    Description: Original theatrical trailer for the Roger Corman comedy/horror classic about a hapless man (Jonathan Haze) who grows a bloodthirty, carnivorous plant.

Adus in biroul comandantului german pentru o presupusa incalcare a interdictiei de a circula noaptea, Iacob aude o stire despre victoriile fortelor sovietice asupra germanilor, intr-un oras aflat nu foarte departe de ghetou. Desi plin de bucurie, el nu poate impartasi vestea compatriotilor sai pentru a nu fi banuit de colaborationism. Totusi, nu trece mult pana cand trebuie sa-si asume acest risc. Pentru a-l impiedica pe unul dintre tinerii sai colegi, Mischa, sa evadeze, el ii da vestea incurajatoare, pretinzand ca a auzit-o la un radio pe care l-a tinut ascuns. Cu noi sperante intr-o viata mai buna, Mischa ii cere mana iubitei sale, Rosa, dar cum parintii acesteia se opun acestei casatorii in conditiile de acolo, le aduce ca argument vestea primita de la Iacob.

We as a Nation, support these men and women, and it is our belief that bringing honor to these American Heroes, in fact promotes healing. \n","This documentary captures the unprecedented effort displayed by an organization called Warrior's Weekend of Victoria, Texas. The determination of hundreds, if not thousands of patriots from the cities of Houston and Victoria as well as other surrounding towns, is manifest in this documentary and displays their dedication and loyalty to our country and appreciation to those who serve in the military.\n","We have captured the blood, sweat and tears that have been shed as over 350 wounded soldiers are brought to Victoria and then on to Port O'Connor, Texas from all over the United States.\n","Warrior's Weekend has created a most dynamic, \"rock star\" environment as these true American heroes get a good dose of Texas hospitality. From the moment their planes land in Houston, or they board a chartered bus at Brooke Army Medical Center or Fort Hood, these men and women are overwhelmed by just how many people honor their service and sacrifice. They are greeted at Faith Family Church by local schools and several hundred more patriots. After refreshments and a quick welcome ceremony, the soldiers are led to the Field of Honor which has over 2,500 large American flags. Each flag represents an individual soldier that local businesses and individuals have purchased.  The flags also bear the names of soldiers that are currently serving or commemorate those who have served our country.  As the service men and women arrive at Port O'Connor, Texas, they are just as captivated at the sight of the highway lined with people and hundreds of American flags being flown to welcome them. Then on to the fishing docks!  There they find 226 fishing vessels set to idle as the boat captains anxiously await the arrival of their American hero. The fishermen help the soldiers board the craft and then off they go to retrieve their bounty. \n","In conjunction with a weekend to be remembered by all, I believe this documentary will touch the hearts and lives of all who see it and restore the importance of honoring those who serve this wonderful country we call America.\n","    Channel Title: BurnsNvictoria\n","    Publish time: 2012-04-05T02:08:21Z\n","    Duration: 4:42\n","    Number of comments: 5\n","    Number of likes: 22\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 5005\n","    \n","    Title: TIME OF THE GYPSIES ( Dom za vesanje  ) -  Trailer( 1988 )\n","    Description: Trailer for Emir Kusturica's Masterpiece\n","    Channel Title: WorleyClarence\n","    Publish time: 2008-04-13T14:32:50Z\n","    Duration: 2:31\n","    Number of comments: 195\n","    Number of likes: 1343\n","    Number of dislikes: 46\n","    Number of views: 778850\n","    \n","    Title: Le Feu Follet - The Fire Within (1963)\n","    Description: The prominent dialogue scene from the movie \"The Fire Within\", directed by Louis Malle.\n","    Channel Title: mirbagheri\n","    Publish time: 2011-10-12T04:49:15Z\n","    Duration: 1:41\n","    Number of comments: 6\n","    Number of likes: 77\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 13016\n","    \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    Title: El amor brujo (de Saura) La boda, Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos (1986)\n","    Description: NOTE:The first 3 seconds of this vid are mostly green; the rest is fine!\n","\n","This is the last of Carlos Saura's flamenco trilogy made in 1986.

Peter Weller returns as RoboCop, a futuristic cyborg fashioned from cutting-edge technology and the biological remains of slain Detroit police officer, Alex Murphy. Still patrolling the city streets, RoboCop is scheduled by his creator, Omni Consumer Products, to be replaced by a new \"superior\" model, RoboCop 2, that according to designer Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer), will contain the human remains not of a cop but a criminal. In the meantime, an instantly addictive drug called Nuke is sweeping through Detroit thanks to a kingpin named Cain (Tom Noonan). Taking Cain to task, RoboCop is captured and dismantled. When he's put back together, the cyborg is reprogrammed with a series of socially conscious commands (in a sly mocking of the then relatively new concept of \"political correctness\") that render him impotent as a law enforcer. Taking charge by rewiring himself with an electrical overload, RoboCop arrests Cain, who is injured in the process.

However, between life and death is a thin thread of understanding and when obsession gets the better of West, there is no stopping his wicked ways – dead or alive!\n","\n","Presented complete and uncut in gore-glistening HD with all-new special features, Re-Animator is a true horror-fest of mortal manipulation in the most demented sense.\n","    Channel Title: Umbrella Entertainment\n","    Publish time: 2015-02-27T00:11:33Z\n","    Duration: 2:14\n","    Number of comments: 83\n","    Number of likes: 1269\n","    Number of dislikes: 35\n","    Number of views: 152601\n","    \n","    Title: DRUGSTORE COWBOY - Trailer ( 1989 )\n","    Description: Trailer for Gus Van Sant's film\n","    Channel Title: WorleyClarence\n","    Publish time: 2008-04-20T13:13:42Z\n","    Duration: 1:23\n","    Number of comments: 193\n","    Number of likes: 1940\n","    Number of dislikes: 44\n","    Number of views: 651895\n","    \n","    Title: Falling Down 1993 Official Trailer\n","    Description: Subscribe if you want to see more videos like this!\n","    Channel Title: JackBauer137\n","    Publish time: 2015-06-25T04:22:55Z\n","    Duration: 2:32\n","    Number of comments: 16\n","    Number of likes: 204\n","    Number of dislikes: 4\n","    Number of views: 40503\n","    \n","    Title: The Funhouse (1981) - Official Trailer\n","    Description: Four teenage friends spent the night in a carnival funhouse and are stalked by a deformed man in a frankenstein mask.\n","\n","Released on 1981\n","Directed by: Tobe Hooper\n","Starring: Elizabeth Berridge, Shawn Carson, Jeanne Austin\n","    Channel Title: horrornymphs\n","    Publish time: 2011-01-11T22:59:53Z\n","    Duration: 1:27\n","    Number of comments: 166\n","    Number of likes: 1287\n","    Number of dislikes: 35\n","    Number of views: 332236\n","    \n","    Title: Piranha (1978) trailer\n","    Description: Trailer for the film \"Piranha\" (1978).\n","    Channel Title: sideshowcarny\n","    Publish time: 2007-03-02T21:22:22Z\n","    Duration: 2:16\n","    Number of comments: 199\n","    Number of likes: 686\n","    Number of dislikes: 65\n","    Number of views: 576428\n","    \n","    Title: Dean Martin \"Rough Night in Jericho\"\n","    Description: Fight scene at the Ace Deuce Palast.\n","God bless you both Dino and George!\n","    Channel Title: JohnDeanDino\n","    Publish time: 2008-10-07T15:02:32Z\n","    Duration: 2:11\n","    Number of comments: 4\n","    Number of likes: 54\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 25511\n","    \n","    Title: Slaughterhouse 1974 Movie Trailer\n","    Description: Subscribe to MovieTrailersByVD: http://bit.ly/QcNd7j\n","More clips, photos, and news: http://bit.ly/UV4rrJ\n","\n","Follow Videodetective.com on facebook http://www.facebook.com/VideoDetective\n","Follow Videodetective.com on twitter http://twitter.com/VideoDetective\n","\n","Subscribe to GameTrailersByVD: http://bit.ly/RNaDlR\n","Subscribe to TVPromosByVD: http://bit.ly/Plupqf\n","Subscribe to MusicVideosByVD: http://bit.ly/Te5RuH\n","\n","Director: \n","Cast: Joe Barton\n","Studio: New Line Home Entertainment\n","Rating: R\n","    Channel Title: Video Detective\n","    Publish time: 2012-12-21T08:07:32Z\n","    Duration: 1:23\n","    Number of comments: 0\n","    Number of likes: 2\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 941\n","    \n","    Title: The Taming of the Shrew (1967) trailer Elizabeth Taylor\n","    Description: The Taming of the Shrew (1967) trailer Please sign ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S birthday card! http://www.DameElizabethTaylor.com/birthday_card.html\n","    Channel Title: dameelizabethtaylor\n","    Publish time: 2009-05-28T04:14:56Z\n","    Duration: 59\n","    Number of comments: 2\n","    Number of likes: 57\n","    Number of dislikes: 6\n","    Number of views: 55644\n","    \n","    Title: Nighthawks (1981) - Trailer\n","    Description: Nighthawks (1981) - Movie Trailer\n","    Channel Title: BugleBoy\n","    Publish time: 2008-02-19T02:24:40Z\n","    Duration: 1:54\n","    Number of comments: 231\n","    Number of likes: 1173\n","    Number of dislikes: 47\n","    Number of views: 300971\n","    \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    Title: YOJIMBO Trailer (1961) - The Criterion Collection\n","    Description: To rid a terror-stricken village of corruption, wily masterless samurai Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune) turns a range war between two evil clans to his own advantage in Akira Kurosawas visually stunning and darkly comic YOJIMBO.\n","\n","Learn more: http://www.criterion.com/films/597\n","    Channel Title: criterioncollection\n","    Publish time: 2010-01-19T20:51:52Z\n","    Duration: 2:56\n","    Number of comments: 128\n","    Number of likes: 2011\n","    Number of dislikes: 17\n","    Number of views: 352831\n","    \n","    Title: REPOSSESSED WEB TRAILER\n","    Description: Available on DVD through www.umbrellaent.com.au\n","\n","1973.

Opening scenes contrast the American and Japanese positions. Japanese imperialists decide to stage the attack. Top U.S. brass ignore it's possibility. Intercepted Japanese messages warn of it - but never reach F.D.R.'s desk. Radar warnings are disregarded. Even the entrapment of a Japanese submarine in Pearl Harbor before the attack goes unreported. Ultimately the Day of Infamy arrives - in the most spectacular, gut-wrenching cavalcade of action-packed footage ever. You'll see moments of unsurpassed spectacle and heroism: U.S. fighters trying to take off and being hit as they taxi; men blasted from the decks of torpedoed ships while trying to rescue buddies; savage aerial dogfights pitting lone American fliers against squadrons of Imperial war planes. It's the most dazzling recreation of America's darkest day - and some of her finest hours.\n","    Channel Title: YouTube Movies\n","    Publish time: 2013-11-28T11:27:56Z\n","    Duration: 3:40\n","    Number of comments: 130\n","    Number of likes: 1354\n","    Number of dislikes: 69\n","    Number of views: 443100\n","    \n","    Title: Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown trailer Almodovar\n","    Description: Almodóvar's Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown American Trailer.\n","\n","It's a romance, but it's not about love...\n","It's a comedy, but not everyone laughs.\n","It's a place where the one that you can expect, is the unexpected...\n","WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN!!!\n","    Channel Title: lamalaeducacion\n","    Publish time: 2009-04-19T15:47:25Z\n","    Duration: 1:46\n","    Number of comments: 29\n","    Number of likes: 386\n","    Number of dislikes: 18\n","    Number of views: 294515\n","    \n","    Title: The Verdict, movie (video) trailer and review\n","    Description: http://clickerz.info/videos\n","Get all types of movies.

És ráadásnak az sem egy utolsó mulatság, ha Newman második rendezését összehasonlítjuk Robert Redford elsõ rendezésével, az Átlagemberekkel.\n","Az elbeszélés és az előadás határozott törekvései szerint megoldást keres, kérdéseket tesz fel és válaszol meg a szeretet (mint gamma-sugár) virágot (mint reményt) fakasztó potenciájáról.\n","\n","„Ha majd a sugárzást jobban megértjük, eljön egy nap, amikor az atomrobbanásból keletkező erő megváltoztatja egész eddig ismert világunkat.

Also featuring Otis Young and a very young Randy Quaid.  Very, very funny with an undertone of seriousness that catches up to the main characters by the end of the film.  Nicholson is fantastic, as usual, but it's one of his smaller films that was immediately overshadowed by \"Chinatown\" and \"Cuckoo's Nest\" that followed in the next two years, respectively.  At the time of the film's release, it was a huge success and Nicholson's performance was regarded highly.  Columbia then pulled the film from release, rereleasing it closer to Oscar time, but any buzz that had been generated had worn off by that time.  Still, Nicholson was nominated as was Robert Towne, the great screenwriter, and Randy Quaid for Best Supporting Actor.  Based on the novel by Darryl Ponicsan.

Achievement-oriented Marcus (Kevin Costner) is a nationally-ranked cyclist. Younger brother David (David Grant) is a drifter, content to cruise through life on a 10-speed. Time-and the painful events surrounding their father's death-have turned the siblings' differences into an open rift. So they try to bridge the gap by competing together in the Hell of the West, a grueling race through the Rocky Mountains. For the first time ever, the brothers train and race side-by-side...while each privately confronts a nagging fear: the congenital ailment that struck down their father could just suddenly strike one of them. Writer Steve Tesich, and Academy Award winner for his bike-racing opus Breaking Away, now captures the sport's excitement on an even larger scale. Against the backdrop of the Coors International Classic, the U.S.'s largest, most prestigious race, Tesich and director John Badham craft a dazzling, spirit-soaring spectacle. Says Rex Reed: \"You'll go away feeling good! American Flyers is a fine mixture of romance, humor and tears with action sequences among the most exciting ever captured on film.\" MPAA Rating: PG-13  (c) 1985 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.

Sisters that do love each other, except when it comes to baseball. Kit wants to play in the league but is upset to hear that it is Dottie who is chosen to play for the AAPGL. (All American Pro Girls League) Dottie refuses to play unless Kit can come along. AAPGL was only made because of the World War II and all of the man were in the war. Along the way to the stadium they meet Marla Hooch who is a great hitter, but to most people not the prettiest girl. When they are going to try out they meet Doris and Mae because Doris threw a baseball at Dottie who caught it impressing Doris. They girls find out their new manager is Jimmy Dugan. Jimmy Dugan drinks a lot and is the worst manager until Dottie get through to him and he becomes a better person. Miss Cuthbert makes sure the rules are followed, no boys, no drinking or smoking until Mae poisons her meal. The girls go to party and Marla who had been overlooked a lot is noticed by a guy named Nelson. Dottie's husband Bob is in the army and when news comes that a man in the army has been killed it turns out to be Betty Spaghetti. After awhile, Kit feels that once again like at home she is behind Dottie's shadow. Dottie notices it to and asks to be transferred to another team. Of course Mr. Lovitz doesn't want the best player to be transferred so he has Kit transferred to Racine. Kit feels that Dottie did this on purpose. Kit plays for the Racine while Dottie plays for Rockford. In the final scene Dottie is crashed into by Kit and she drops the ball, letting Racine win, making Kit have her own stardom instead of being in Dottie's shadow. The girls have a reunion and they remember the fun they had together.\n","    Channel Title: MovieSpoilerSite\n","    Publish time: 2009-11-04T00:16:11Z\n","    Duration: 2:40\n","    Number of comments: 161\n","    Number of likes: 1460\n","    Number of dislikes: 74\n","    Number of views: 712633\n","    \n","    Title: Patriot Games (1992) Trailer\n","    Description: Patriot Games (1992) Trailer\n","    Channel Title: movierandolf\n","    Publish time: 2008-04-17T12:15:02Z\n","    Duration: 2:33\n","    Number of comments: 128\n","    Number of likes: 371\n","    Number of dislikes: 27\n","    Number of views: 407241\n","    \n","    Title: Death Becomes Her (1992) Official Trailer - Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn Movie HD\n","    Description: \"Subscribe to CLASSIC TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u43jDe\n","Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\n","Subscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\n","Like us on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/1QyRMsE\n","Follow us on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/1ghOWmt\"\n","Death Becomes Her (1992) Official Trailer - Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn Movie HD\n","\n","When a woman learns of an immortality treatment, she sees it as a way to outdo her long-time rival.\n","\n","Welcome to the Fandango MOVIECLIPS Trailer Vault Channel.

The interwoven fates and misfortunes of these three families and the diverging trajectories of the two sisters’ lives are connected to the ownership of Howards End, a beloved country home.

It is the third movie adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1937 novel of the same name. The first adaptation was made in 1939, and a made-for-TV movie version was produced in 1981. It was released on October 2, 1992 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures.\n","\n","George Milton (Gary Sinise) is in a train boxcar, reminiscing upon the events that have just happened. He thinks back to when he and his companion Lennie Small (John Malkovich), who has learning difficulties and the mentality of a small child, are fleeing from their previous employment in Weed. They were run out of town after Lennie was accused of attempted rape when he touched and held onto a young woman's pretty dress (prompted by his love of stroking soft things). After running from Weed, George and Lennie are trying to attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream, which he never tires of hearing George describe, is merely to have soft rabbits on the farm, which he can pet. The two go to work at a ranch named Tyler Ranch.\n","\n","At the ranch, the dream appears to move closer to reality. Candy (Ray Walston), the aged, one-handed ranch-hand, offers to pitch in with Lennie and George so they can buy the farm. The dream disappears when Lennie accidentally kills the young and attractive wife (Sherilyn Fenn) of Curley (Casey Siemaszko), the ranch owner's son, while trying to stroke her hair. A lynch mob led by Curley gathers. Realizing he is doomed to a life of loneliness and despair like the rest of the migrant workers, and wanting to spare Lennie a painful death at the hands of the vengeful and violent Curley, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head before the mob can find him. The film comes to a close with the opening scene of George reminiscing in the train boxcar. The last minute of the movie depicts another memory: George and Lennie working together.\n","    Channel Title: helenalief\n","    Publish time: 2010-10-07T12:16:36Z\n","    Duration: 2:23\n","    Number of comments: 377\n","    Number of likes: 795\n","    Number of dislikes: 42\n","    Number of views: 408570\n","    \n","    Title: Scream 3 (2000) - Movie Trailer\n","    Description: Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) visits the set of \"Stab 3\", after pictures of her mother become the clue to a series of murders around Hollywood. \n","\n","Directed by: Wes Craven.\n","\n","Cast: Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Patrick Dempsey.\n","\n","Release Date: February 4, 2000.\n","    Channel Title: The Trailer Guy\n","    Publish time: 2010-12-02T21:55:13Z\n","    Duration: 1:38\n","    Number of comments: 380\n","    Number of likes: 1257\n","    Number of dislikes: 75\n","    Number of views: 700869\n","    \n","    Title: Single White Female (1992) Trailer\n","    Description: An ad for a roommate brought a stranger into Allison's life.

Disgusted with the inauthenticity of common society, Richard treks across Asia while avoiding all tourist settings at all costs.  In a shoddy Bangkok hotel, Richard meets a man who appears to be insane and calls himself Daffy.  Daffy tells Richard of a paradise unlike any other; a paradise in its purest form, untouched by humans exploiting nature.  When Richard awakens to find a crudely drawn map and that Daffy had killed himself, he decides to embark on a journey to find this paradise lagoon.  The Beach features a strong isolated island atmosphere and plenty of gorgeous scenery and backdrops.

Richard E. Byrd\n","\n","\"In 1928, Admiral Byrd began his first expedition to the Antarctic involving two ships, and three airplanes: Byrd's Flagship was The City of New York; a Ford Trimotor called the Floyd Bennett (named after the recently deceased pilot of Byrd's previous expeditions); a Fairchild FC-2W2, NX8006, built 1928, named \"Stars And Stripes\" (now displayed at the Virginia Aviation Museum, on loan from the National Air and Space Museum); and a Fokker Universal monoplane called the Virginia (Byrd's birth state). A base camp named \"Little America\" was constructed on the Ross Ice Shelf and scientific expeditions by snowshoe, dog-sled, snowmobile, and airplane began. Photographic expeditions and geological surveys were undertaken for the duration of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on 28 November 1929, the famous flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot Bernt Balchen, co-pilot/radioman Harold June, and photographer Ashley McKinley, flew the Ford Trimotor to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty gas tanks, as well as their emergency supplies, in order to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau. However, the flight was successful, and it entered Byrd into the history books. After a further summer of exploration, the expedition returned to North America on 18 June 1930. A 19 year-old American Boy Scout, Paul Allman Siple, was chosen to accompany the expedition. Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the American Geographical Society. This was also seen in the 1930 film With Byrd at the South Pole in which it covered his trip there.\n","Byrd, by then an internationally recognized, pioneering American polar explorer and aviator, served for a time as Honorary National President (1931--1935) of Pi Gamma Mu, the international honor society in the social sciences. In 1928, he carried the Society's flag during a historic expedition to the Antarctic to dramatize the spirit of adventure into the unknown, characterizing both the natural and social sciences\"\n","\n","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd\n","    Channel Title: SecureUsb\n","    Publish time: 2011-11-21T04:08:13Z\n","    Duration: 1:3:28\n","    Number of comments: 97\n","    Number of likes: 338\n","    Number of dislikes: 20\n","    Number of views: 77635\n","    \n","    Title: Boiler Room (2000) Teaser (VHS Capture)\n","    Description: Teaser for Boiler Room (2000) captured from the Final Destination (2000) VHS tape.

Al Reinert watched all the footage shot during the missions--over 6,000,000 feet of it, and picked out the best. Instead of being a newsy, fact-filled documentary, Reinart focuses on the human aspects of the space flights. The only voices heard in the film are the voices of the astronauts and mission control. Reinart uses the astronaunts' own words from interviews and from the mission footage. The score by Brian Eno underscores the strangeness, wonder, and and beauty of the astronauts' experiences--experiences which they were privileged to have for a first time \"for all mankind.\"  \n","Review by Scott B.

After an initial period of conflict between the two groups, their enmity turns to respect and friendship and the unit is sent Italy to attempt a dangerous mission which has heretofore been considered impossible to successfully complete. The Canadians are the best that the Canadian army has to offer: spit and polish, multi-skilled and all experienced soldiers. The Americans are the dregs of the US Army: misfits and troublemakers lacking any kind of discipline. Over time, Frederick forges a unified, highly competent fighting force. Initially trained for a commando operation in Norway, Frederick has to move quickly to keep the unit together after the operation is canceled.

Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Warner Bros.

In addition to Stone, it casts American actor Christopher Rydell as the bullfighter hero Juan Gallardo. Her role was previously essayed in 1922 by Nita Naldi and in 1940 by Rita Hayworth. The story remains the same: a dirt-poor youth rises to fame and fortune in the bull ring, forgets his roots, cheats on his wife, has a last-minute change of heart, and pays for his sins in grotesque fashion.\n","The story revolves around the young, talented, and naturally gifted torero Juan Gallardo. Gallardo wants to be popular in bull fighting. His love Carmen has a cousin who has left home with Gallardo for a bullfighting competition. After a bull charges the neophyte Gallardo, his friend intercepts and saves Gallardo at the cost of his own life.\n","A despondent Gallardo runs away and meets Lady Dona Sol (played by Stone), a beautiful, rich lady, who offers him a job to work her fields. However, Gallardo insists on becoming a superstar in bull fighting in his country, and, on the advice of a security guard, he joins the famous bull fighting trainer, Nacional. Nacional trains and prepares Gallardo for competition.\n","Turmoil and tragedy ensue as the triangle unfolds...\n","    Channel Title: bopaulmediaworldwide\n","    Publish time: 2012-10-24T19:51:02Z\n","    Duration: 2:9\n","    Number of comments: 16\n","    Number of likes: 165\n","    Number of dislikes: 17\n","    Number of views: 132089\n","    \n","    Title: Three Reasons: Lord of the Flies\n","    Description: Those are our three reasons.

The film holds many of Kurosawa's hallmarks as a director: Thoughts on everyday life, subtle philosophy brewing underneath, great cinematography and camerawork, long shots, and of course plenty of wind!\n","\n","This scene is probably the most memorable from the film. The captain and his guide, Dersu, find themselves separated from the rest of their men and lost in the deep Siberian tundra. There, in order to survive, they have to build a shelter of straw before the night falls over the land. It is a breathtaking (literally) scene, with a lot more quality than any Spielberg or Bay-movie that tend to crowd the cinemas nowadays.\n","\n","I'm sorry about the video quality, it could have been a lot better.

In this film, directed by Ted Kotcheff (The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz), the National Football League is revealed to be more about the money than the game. Nick Nolte is North Dallas Bulls pass-catcher Phillip Elliott, whose cynicism and independent spirit is looked upon as troublesome by team coaches Johnson (Charles Durning) and Strothers (G.D. Spradlin) and team owner Conrad Hunter (Steve Forrest). Elliot, at the end of his career and wise to the way players are bought and sold like cattle, goes through the games pumped up on painkillers conveniently provided by the management. His teammates include savvy quarterback Maxwell (Mac Davis) and lunk-headed defensive lineman Jo Bob Priddy (Bo Svenson), who deal with the impersonality and back-biting of the game through off-field diversions. When the Bulls management benches Elliot after manipulating him to help train a fellow teammate, Elliot has to decide whether there is more to life than the game that he loves.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Paramount (1979)\n","Cast: Mac Davis, Nick Nolte\n","Director: Ted Kotcheff\n","Producers: Frank Baur, Jack B.

If given a fair chance, it is very enjoyable, and features great acting, production, and a good plot overall. Robert Shaw and Harrison Ford have co-starring leads, with Ford being fresh from the role that made him a household name--Han Solo in STAR WARS. Ford portrays American Ranger Lt. Col. Mike Barnsby, the leader of a commando unit sent to Yugoslavia to destroy a vital bridge that will allow Nazi forces to move into Partisan territory. Shaw's character is Major Mallory, who joins Barnsby's unit but has a mission of his own: seek out and elminate a double agent operating with the Yugoslavian resistance fighters. This movie is also of note because it marked Robert Shaw's final film appearance. He died of a heart attack shortly after finishing the project.

At one point Fosse spitefully reduced all Grey’s musical numbers to snippets (the producers put it all back). The finished movie won eight Oscars including Best Director for Fosse and Best Actress for star Liza Minnelli, who never had a better role. Christopher Isherwood’s “Berlin Stories”, which introduced the character of Sally Bowles, had been filmed as a straight drama in 1955 under the title I Am a Camera.\n","\n","As always, you can find more commentary, more reviews, more podcasts, and more deep-dives into the films you don't know you love yet over on the Trailers From Hell mothership: \n","\n","http://www.trailersfromhell.com\n","\n","On our podcast THE MOVIES THAT MADE ME, join Oscar-nominated screenwriter Josh Olson and TFH Fearless Leader Joe Dante in conversation with filmmakers, comedians, and all-around interesting people about the movies that made them who they are.

The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.  \n","\n","Genre:History/Action\n","Director:Ridley Scott\n","Cast:Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed\n","    Channel Title: FilmTrailersChannel\n","    Publish time: 2009-08-22T16:36:21Z\n","    Duration: 1:23\n","    Number of comments: 505\n","    Number of likes: 2476\n","    Number of dislikes: 166\n","    Number of views: 2397137\n","    \n","    Title: Human Traffic (1999) trailer\n","    Description: Trailer for the 1999 film \"Human Traffic\", directed by Justin Kerrigan and starring John Simm, Lorraine Pilkington, Shaun Parkes, Danny Dyer and Nicola Reynolds.\n","    Channel Title: simmspotting\n","    Publish time: 2008-05-27T16:53:59Z\n","    Duration: 1:30\n","    Number of comments: 155\n","    Number of likes: 1145\n","    Number of dislikes: 46\n","    Number of views: 581543\n","    \n","    Title: The Idolmaker 1980 TV trailer\n","    Description: A television preview for director Taylor Hackford's 1980 musical drama starring Ray Sharkey, Peter Gallagher, Tovah Feldshuh, Paul Land, Joe Pantoliano, and Maureen McCormick.\n","    Channel Title: robatsea2009\n","    Publish time: 2012-05-01T22:59:36Z\n","    Duration: 30\n","    Number of comments: 1\n","    Number of likes: 28\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 7020\n","    \n","    Title: Inferno (1980) Trailer\n","    Description: Inferno (1980) Trailer\n","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080923/\n","Director: Dario Argento\n","Leigh McCloskey, Irene Miracle, Eleonora Giorgi, Daria Nicolodi\n","    Channel Title: Danios12345\n","    Publish time: 2011-09-16T22:09:25Z\n","    Duration: 3:18\n","    Number of comments: 24\n","    Number of likes: 151\n","    Number of dislikes: 7\n","    Number of views: 54612\n","    \n","    Title: The Lords of Flatbush 1974 TV trailer\n","    Description: A television spot for the 1974 film starring Perry King, Sylvester Stallone, Henry Winkler, Paul Mace,Susan Blakely, Maria Smith, and Renee Paris.\n","    Channel Title: robatsea2009\n","    Publish time: 2012-09-05T09:16:50Z\n","    Duration: 32\n","    Number of comments: 14\n","    Number of likes: 74\n","    Number of dislikes: 1\n","    Number of views: 20817\n","    \n","    Title: Mr. Mom (1983) Official Trailer  - Michael Keaton, Teri Garr Movie HD\n","    Description: Mr. Mom (1983) Official Trailer  - Michael Keaton, Teri Garr Movie HD\n","Subscribe to CLASSIC TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u43jDe\n","Subscribe to TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/sxaw6h\n","Subscribe to COMING SOON: http://bit.ly/H2vZUn\n","Like us on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/1QyRMsE\n","Follow us on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/1ghOWmt\n","\n","After he's laid off, a husband switches roles with his wife.

By intercutting emotional testimonials from women on both sides of the war who share their suffering, she makes us understand how real this war remains. Through seeing many different women's perspectives, we recognize how their emotions contrasted: helplessness on the part of those in the United States versus inevitable participation by North and South Vietnamese women.\n","\n","A very powerful, yet quiet, film, Regret to Inform develops a yet-unseen perspective: that of those left behind. Focused on Vietnamese and American women, the film is filled with exceptional interviews which are revealing and poignant. Testimony to Sonneborn 's uncommon ability is the remarkable level of honesty and openness the women are willing to share on camera. The viewer is taken on an uncommonly well-crafted journey, which includes beautiful camerawork and a seamless mixture of new and archival footage. Deeply personal and vastly universal, Regret to Inform is an involving and moving lesson about the painful legacy of war.\n","\n","\n","AWARDS\n","\n","HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL 1999\n","WINNER!

Aside from Curse of the Undead (1959), Billy the Kid Meets Dracula and Jesse James vs. Frankenstein's Daughter (both 1966), that concept had been pretty much unexplored.  Boxoffice returns were unexciting, but it found an appreciative audience on video. A modern remake co-written by Bigelow started shooting in 2007 but remains uncompleted, having been put on hold due to its similarity to the Twilight series.\n","\n","Brought to you by http://www.trailersfromhell.com\n","    Channel Title: Trailers From Hell\n","    Publish time: 2012-08-08T17:05:59Z\n","    Duration: 2:26\n","    Number of comments: 17\n","    Number of likes: 132\n","    Number of dislikes: 3\n","    Number of views: 16196\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    \n","    Title: onefalsemove-.mpg\n","    Description: Trailer for 'One False Move' (1992)\n","    Channel Title: DarrenJSeeley\n","    Publish time: 2011-08-18T16:08:00Z\n","    Duration: 1:27\n","    Number of comments: 6\n","    Number of likes: 64\n","    Number of dislikes: 3\n","    Number of views: 30567\n","    \n","    Title: Shaft trailer (1971)\n","    Description: Can you dig it?\n","    Channel Title: Edward Crosby\n","    Publish time: 2007-09-06T01:08:25Z\n","    Duration: 3:12\n","    Number of comments: 232\n","    Number of likes: 1138\n","    Number of dislikes: 49\n","    Number of views: 662955\n","    \n","    Title: The Conversation - Trailer - HQ\n","    Description: Trailer for Francis Ford Coppola's film starring Gene Hackman,John Cazale,Allen Garfield,Frederic Forrest,Harrison Ford,Cindy Williams,Michael Higgins,Robert Duvall,Teri Garr,Elizabeth MacRae\n","    Channel Title: ryy79\n","    Publish time: 2008-12-22T20:06:14Z\n","    Duration: 2:43\n","    Number of comments: 114\n","    Number of likes: 713\n","    Number of dislikes: 9\n","    Number of views: 187789\n","    \n","    Title: Cutter's Way trailer\n","    Description: trailer for film\n","    Channel Title: felixxxx999\n","    Publish time: 2010-07-26T20:58:54Z\n","    Duration: 2:41\n","    Number of comments: 20\n","    Number of likes: 96\n","    Number of dislikes: 7\n","    Number of views: 53927\n","    \n","    Title: CBS The Fury 1980 TV promo #2\n","    Description: A second network promo spot for their debut broadcast of director Brian DePalma's 1978 supernatural thriller, starring Kirk Douglas, John Cassavettes, Amy Irving, Andrew Stevens, Charles Durning, Carrie Snodgress, and Fiona Lewis.\n","    Channel Title: robatsea2009\n","    Publish time: 2016-06-24T10:26:28Z\n","    Duration: 24\n","    Number of comments: 0\n","    Number of likes: 11\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 3517\n","    \n","    Title: The Paper Chase | #TBT Trailer | 20th Century FOX\n","    Description: Expecting only the basic pressures of attending Harvard Law School, a serious, hard-working student (Timothy Bottoms) finds himself the fearful adversary of the school's most imperious, sarcastic professor (John Houseman).

James \"Slim\" Stewart and Henry Fonda were long time friends and roommates in NYC in their halcyon Broadway stage days, and here they are together in 1948 in a nearly forgotten little comedy called \"On Our Merry Way\", an episodic comedy tied together with Burgess Meredith's character playing a reporter doing a story about Children. In this scene Hank and Jimmy are musicians traveling with a ragtag band in a beat up old bus. Down on their luck they happen on an aspiring horn player (Played here by Carl \"alfalfa\" Switzer, who had a tiny role 2 years earlier with Jimmy Stewart in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" as a  Mischeivous high school kid who opens up the dance floor to drop the dancing kids into the swimming pool~!)  \n"," \n","Here, Carl plays a young \"Hepcat\" who dreams of a life traveling with such a band. \n","Dig his way-out rendition of \"You must have been a beautiful Baby\" as he plays along with the great Harry James. \"Beat me, Daddy!\"\n","Stewart and Fonda are way too \"unhep\" to be real Jazz bohos, and it's still too early in 1948 to give much creedence to the new Jazz phenomenon called BeBop. They play a safe, watered down form of Swing. Yet, it is still a pleasure to see these real life pals onscreen together (in spite of their growing postwar political differences) at the young ages of 40 and 43. James Stewart would never seem this young again.\n"," \n"," \n","Here's another segment of the 1948 film that shows Fred MacMurray in an early comedic role along side his future TV costar in \"My Three Sons\", William Demarest, who would play Uncle Charlie 12 years later for the duration of the show (after a season with William Frawley, of course). Fred started out as a leading man only to discover he had a gift for light comedy. Look at his adroit handling of these magic tricks. Although MacMurray and Fonda starred together in their earliest roles, the Technicolor film, \"trail  of the Lonesome Pine\", it's too bad Fred and his real life friend James Stewart weren't in any scenes together in this one. Their's might have been a cinematic teaming that could have really thrived!   \n","-Enjoy this rare bit of 20th century Americana\n","    Channel Title: MisterEsoteric\n","    Publish time: 2009-07-18T08:05:15Z\n","    Duration: 7:45\n","    Number of comments: 22\n","    Number of likes: 61\n","    Number of dislikes: 1\n","    Number of views: 19550\n","    \n","    Title: Rocketship X-M (1950) - Movie Trailer\n","    Description: Led by the intrepid Col.

The \"ideal\" brain belongs to the hapless Lou Costello, whom the lady doctor woos to gain his confidence and lure him to the operating table. Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), better known as the Wolf Man, arrives on the scene to warn Costello and his pal Bud Abbott of Dracula's nefarious schemes. Throughout the film, the timorous Costello witnesses the nocturnal rituals of Dracula and the Monster, but can't convince the ever-doubting Abbott--until the wild climax in Dracula's castle, where the comedians are pursued by all three of the film's monstrosities. As a bonus, the Invisible Man (voiced by an unbilled Vincent Price) shows up for \"all the excitement.\"\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Universal (1948)\n","Cast: Bud Abbott, Lon Chaney Jr., Lou Costello, Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price, Glenn Strange, Lenore Aubert\n","Director: Charles Barton\n","Producer: Robert Arthur\n","Screenwriters: John Grant, Robert Lees, Bram Stoker, Frederic I.

After considering 100 projects for a successor to The Music Man, Willson found one that was irresistible. And unsinkable. Debbie Reynolds plays the title role, inviting all to Belly Up to the Bar, Boys for the whoop-and-holler film of Willson's 1960 Broadway hit. Reynolds won a 1964 Best Actress Oscar® nomination as the backwoods heroine who survives the Titanic and the snobbery of Denver society. Screen-debuting Harve Presnell reprises his stage role of Johnny, who has heartful-and-a-half of love for Molly. Johnny wasn't alone. Astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young so admired the movie they named their Gemini 3 spacecraft Molly Brown.

With the goal of securing her promotion, Lily ventures into the most isolated areas of the mountains to collect the songs and finds herself increasingly enchanted - not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the raw courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harshest conditions. It is not, however, until she meets Tom - a handsome, hardened war veteran and talented musician - that she's forced to examine her motivations.

Luckily, thanks to the bravery of two men, President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev, war was averted. \n","\n","The year is 1962. USAF U-2 spy planes discover that the USSR is placing nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba. The Chiefs of Staff warns President Kennedy and his cabinet that the missiles have the potential to kill up to 80 million Americans, and destroy a large number of USAF bomber bases, crippling the U.S. ability to retaliate and leaving the country an easy target for Soviet invasion. Fortunately, the missiles are not yet operational, and the President and his staff try to figure out how to get the missiles out of Cuba, whether by diplomatic means or by force. \n","\n","\"Nuclear catastrophe was hanging by a thread ... and we weren't counting days or hours, but minutes.\", Soviet Army General, Anatoly Gribkov.\n","    Channel Title: TopGunMilitary\n","    Publish time: 2009-11-25T00:34:55Z\n","    Duration: 2:46\n","    Number of comments: 24\n","    Number of likes: 113\n","    Number of dislikes: 7\n","    Number of views: 116903\n","    \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["    Title: Traffic Trailer (2000)\n","    Description: Director: Steven Soderbergh\n","Cast: Michael Douglas;Benicio de Toro; Dennis Quaid; Catherine Zeta-Jones; Salma Hayek.\n","Plot:A conservative judge is appointed by the President to spearhead America's escalating war against drugs, only to discover that his teenage daughter is an addict.\n","    Channel Title: Face Off\n","    Publish time: 2008-08-06T16:03:18Z\n","    Duration: 2:23\n","    Number of comments: 73\n","    Number of likes: 350\n","    Number of dislikes: 100\n","    Number of views: 601745\n","    \n","    Title: The Claim (2000) Trailer\n","    Description:  \n","    Channel Title: ThatMovieTrailerGuy\n","    Publish time: 2011-05-09T21:45:19Z\n","    Duration: 2:15\n","    Number of comments: 3\n","    Number of likes: 33\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 55949\n","    \n","    Title: House of Games (David Mamet, 1987) Theatrical Trailer\n","    Description: The complete trailer to David Mamet's 1987 intelligent thriller, \"House of Games\" starring Joe Mantegna and Lindsay Crouse.\n","    Channel Title: ColdBishop\n","    Publish time: 2008-12-03T07:28:05Z\n","    Duration: 2:2\n","    Number of comments: 36\n","    Number of likes: 185\n","    Number of dislikes: 9\n","    Number of views: 111185\n","    \n","    Title: Kill Me Again (1989)\n","    Description: Val Kilmer in Kill Me Again\n","    Channel Title: felixxxx999\n","    Publish time: 2011-06-02T16:03:55Z\n","    Duration: 34\n","    Number of comments: 0\n","    Number of likes: 9\n","    Number of dislikes: 0\n","    Number of views: 8221\n","    \n","    Title: Annie Trailer HD\n","    Description: In Theaters:7 July 1982\n","\n","In the depths of the 1930's, Annie is a fiery young orphan girl who must live in a miserable orphanage run by the tyrannical Miss Hannigan.

Macy), a sad-eyed mournful man, goes into psychotherapy: he discloses he's a hit man. He also tells the doctor (John Ritter), after a few sessions, that he's attracted to a young woman he's met in the waiting room. She's Sarah (Neve Campbell), 23, quick, edgy, and perhaps attracted to him as well. But he's married, the dutiful father of a young precocious boy, so Sarah brushes him off.

Sure, each member has her foibles. Diane, the captain of the squad who is madly in love with Lincoln High star quarterback Jack Bartlett, has nuclear-powered enthusiasm. Hannah is righteously born-again. Kansas, the rebel whose mother is doing time in the local prison, can't help but talk trashy. Lucy is a geek obsessed with going to Harvard. And Cleo has fantasies of stalking Conan O'Brien. High school is mostly heaven for these paragons of teenage bliss - until Jack and Diane find themselves in an unexpected adult situation, and in desperate need of extra cash. In order to help their friend Diane, the A-Squad goes where no cheerleader has gone before: taking on a little after-school project known as bank robbery. But like five Bonnies without a Clyde, the A-Squad does things their way - with a little sugar and a lot of spice. \n","\n","* IMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186589/\n","    Channel Title: Marla Sokoloff\n","    Publish time: 2011-08-23T22:39:50Z\n","    Duration: 2:19\n","    Number of comments: 87\n","    Number of likes: 1157\n","    Number of dislikes: 36\n","    Number of views: 383117\n","    \n","    Title: Amy (the movie) Trailer - Rachel Griffiths\n","    Description: Original theatrical trailer of the feature film Amy, starring Rachel Griffiths, Ben Mendelsohn, and Alana De Roma.\n","\n","Amy: she taught the world to sing\n","\n","Special edition DVD re-release coming soon.

Martin Brody had died of a heart attack, although his widow, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), claims that \"it was the fear [of the shark] that killed him.\" She discusses with her youngest son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), and his fiance Tiffany (Mary Smith), arrangements for the Christmas season. Now working as a police deputy in Amity, Sean is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy. As he does so, he is attacked by a shark. He is killed as his screams are drowned out by the carol singers on the island.\n","Ellen is convinced that the shark had deliberately targeted Sean due to some evil curse, and visits her eldest son, Michael (Lance Guest), in the Bahamas. Michael now works as a marine biologist. Fearing he will be attacked next by the shark, Ellen hopes to convince him to take up a new job on dry land. She meets Hoagie (Michael Caine), and they begin dating. Michael's wife Carla (Karen Young) is an artist and one day during her art exhibit, Ellen's granddaughter Thea (Judith Barsi) asks if she can go out on a banana boat with her friend Margaret and her mother (Diane Hetfield). The shark attacks the boat with Thea on it. The shark ends up devouring Margaret's mother in the process with blood flying everywhere, leaving Thea unharmed, but in a state of shock. Ellen becomes convinced that the shark has tracked her family to the Bahamas. She takes a boat out to sea on her own, intent on confronting and killing the shark to break the curse, or sacrificing herself hoping the shark will leave her family alone.\n","\n","\n","The shark leaps out of the water to attack Jake (Mario Van Peebles)\n","Hoagie flies Michael and his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles) out to sea so that they can find Ellen quickly. Hoagie lands the plane on the sea, but the shark sinks it. Looking out for the shark while using a device that emits electromagnetic impulses to drive the shark mad, Jake moves to the end of the prow. The shark unexpectedly leaps from the surface of the water to grab Jake, biting into him and dragging him beneath the surface in a gory fashion. The device causes the shark to repeatedly leap out of the water and Ellen steers the boat directly for the shark, impaling it on the broken bowsprit, which somehow causes it to explode. After killing the shark, they find Jake mauled but alive. Near the end of the film, Ellen is relieved that the curse of the shark is no longer on her family. The film ends as Hoagie flies Ellen back to Amity Island.\n","    Channel Title: James Mercuri\n","    Publish time: 2009-02-22T00:22:55Z\n","    Duration: 1:5\n","    Number of comments: 308\n","    Number of likes: 453\n","    Number of dislikes: 76\n","    Number of views: 617469\n","    \n","    Title: Scene from \"Leonard Part 6\"\n","    Description: A hilarious shoot-out occurring early in the \"beloved\" Bill Cosby vehicle \"Leonard Part 6\".\n","\n","Read my review of the movie here: http://www.cincity2000.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1099\n","\n","UPDATE April 1st, 2013:\n","Just wanted to drop in and say: WOW, over 30,000 views and 133 comments?

Oddly enough, he co-starred with Randy Quaid in both films as well. This is a great film for any fan of Porsches, or 1980's yuppie-Hollywood stereotypes. The script was written by Dick Wolf of \"Law & Order\" fame. Charlie Sheen was injured when a squib hardened overnight, and was detonated at the wrong time. He suffered lacerations to his face, and was knocked unconscious. He also received nine stitches, and was deaf in one ear for four weeks. This movie was also Brad Pitt's feature film debut. Even though he was unaccredited, he was featured as a waiter in the final cut of the movie. Most people are probably glad this movie has made it's way into total obscurity. Well, except guys like me that is..(ie. dork-historians)...The music by \"Blancmange\" in the dance club scene is great. The film is scored by Basil Poledouris. Several obscure LA bands play in this, and I have yet to find any recordings of some of the songs in the movie.\n","\n","(NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENTS HERE, I OWN NOTHING FROM NML.)\n","    Channel Title: Finished\n","    Publish time: 2007-12-20T20:28:40Z\n","    Duration: 1:41\n","    Number of comments: 2\n","    Number of likes: 848\n","    Number of dislikes: 23\n","    Number of views: 223798\n","    \n","    Title: North Shore 1987 TV trailer\n","    Description: An original television trailer for the 1987 surfing movie \"North Shore\", starring Matt Adler, Nia Peeples, Gregory Harrison and Gerry Lopez.\n","    Channel Title: robatsea2009\n","    Publish time: 2011-12-06T09:48:17Z\n","    Duration: 31\n","    Number of comments: 3\n","    Number of likes: 33\n","    Number of dislikes: 2\n","    Number of views: 38663\n","    \n","    Title: Head Over Heels trailer\n","    Description: Trailer for 'Head Over Heels', starring Monica Potter, Freddie Prinze, Jr., and Shalom Harlow\n","    Channel Title: pbiasizzo\n","    Publish time: 2011-04-07T07:07:33Z\n","    Duration: 2:15\n","    Number of comments: 84\n","    Number of likes: 2129\n","    Number of dislikes: 58\n","    Number of views: 731812\n","    \n","    Title: VALENTINE MOVIE TRAILER\n","    Description: The trailer of  the movie \"Valentine\" 2001, the best Erotic Thriller ever been made....\n","    Channel Title: TheAlpacino921\n","    Publish time: 2009-08-06T03:22:41Z\n","    Duration: 2:42\n","    Number of comments: 126\n","    Number of likes: 459\n","    Number of dislikes: 34\n","    Number of views: 261960\n","    \n","    Title: In the Mood for Love - Trailer\n","    Description: Staring Maggie Cheung and Tony Liung Chiu Wai.

After an initially winning time, Allison finds herself drawn to the hot new guy in school, leaving Berke in the lurch. At the risk of ruining his unsteady reputation, Berke concocts a scheme for getting Allison back: he will join the school production of A Midsummer Night's Dream and prove his romanticism to her. Realizing he needs an effective acting coach, he turns to Kelly (Kirsten Dunst), who was once the annoying little sister of a best friend and has suddenly blossomed into a grownup -- to whom Berke finds himself drawn. Berke must then decide if getting Allison back is the ultimate priority, as he falls for the more sensible Kelly, all while trying to maintain a credible presence both in school and in his new acting gig. Get Over It also features R&B singer Sisqo, comedian Martin Short, and Shane West in supporting roles.\n","\n","CREDITS:\n","TM & © Miramax Films (2001)\n","Cast: Ed Begley Jr., Ben Foster, Colin Hanks, Martin Short, Sisqó, Dov Tiefenbach, Shane West, Kirsten Dunst, Mila Kunis, Swoosie Kurtz, Melissa Sagemiller\n","Director: Tommy O'Haver\n","Producers: Michael Burns, Marc Butan, Leanna Creel, Paul Feldsher, Richard Hull, Jeremy Kramer, Jill Sobel Messick, Louise Rosner\n","Screenwriter: R.
